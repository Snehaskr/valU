ValU provides a curated resource for individuals to learn about companies that may align with their top ranked values and priorities with regards to corporate culture. Our website provides visual displays of information scraped from Indeed and other data sets regarding corporate diversity, so that user's may hear directly from others like them in a visual, clear, and easily discernible manner. 

Our project is broken down into several parts: data scraping, followed by sentiment and syntax analysis, data organization, data visualization, and front-end development. 

We began retrieving data sources from a diversity database and Indeed.com. We scraped the data from Indeed and reconciled the companies in the database with the scraped data. We created tables with 1000 reviews for each of the companies we were analyzing. After scraping the review data, we passed it to our teammates to perform syntax analysis.



This data was then used to create a SQLite database.
