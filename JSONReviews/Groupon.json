"content":"I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Simply put...This place is about to be shut down... extremely disorganized, many times a day, orders and entire pallets of product could not be located Communicating with internal employees and suppliers. Promotion is not done from knowledge of the job. Workplace culture is okay. Hardest part of the job is the no compensation, but expected to take a bigger workload. Most enjoyable is working on the computer all day. Very low phone contact. easy job, but if you miss a few days might be hard to meet your target.  great entry level position for someone just getting into the sales field or out of college. Overall it is a great work environment and benefits! They are definitely all for volunteer work and making sure that their employees are involved in their community. Groupon has fantastic sales training, on occasion almost too much.  Sometimes they would have one too many meetings during the day, which would take away from selling, if you were a selling manager.  The culture @ HQ was much better than if you were off campus in working from home, it can get a bit lonely. So, it was an internship, so the pay wasn't great:  $12/hour.  But I got to work on Inclusion and Diversity, and the I&D department is incredible!!!  Really the most advanced I&D work around.  If you're interested in that kind of work, Groupon is fantastic.  They like to portray that it's one of those Seattle-like tech firms with Playstations and free soft drinks, but the culture is really kind of cut-throat and is very high performance.  So if you like that kind of thing, this is the company for you!!!! Groupon was a safe, fun and goal driven enviroment workplace. We have training from our latin america headquarters in Chile and also from our caribbean supervisors in México. The workplace culture was a fun one, they don't have a rigid dress code because the work was goal driven. Groupon's main problem is that they do not value their employees. They said many times that everyone is replaceable. VP's and Executive team are detached from reality and don't really understand the day to day. Beautiful work space and everyone makes you feel welcome.   The training is excellent for phone sales.  I loved coming to work everyday.  Team outings are also fun. The work is easy, but the management is not good at all. Also you can not advance unless someone is no longer in that position. That is very rare. Almost all positions higher up are full and you can’t really go any further than someone working on the floor. Groupon is currently and swiftly being reduced to framework/infrastructure teams in the US, and all new development outsourced to Bangalore. They keep the lights on, and their 'AI' & recommendation system is smoke and mirrors. Don't expect to find a place that is innovating. I've seen the same inventory on the landing page for 6 years, there is no relevance intelligence happening beyond a basic e-commerce level of location.  There are C and D level leftover engineers from Google and Yahoo acting as 'principal' engineers that barely contribute. Management turnover was happening fairly quickly while I was working there and this changed the whole work culture.   Lot's of issues around trust and people stepping on others trying to get ahead.   Very young, inexperienced crowd working there. Great place to internManager has been extremely involved in helping me pursue my own career goals and interest areasExtremely positive atmosphere and appropriate work life balance A typical day at work was fast paced and pretty busy.  I learned to be an effective Supervisor for my team.  The culture of the company was laid back.  The job wasn't hard because all the information needed to resolve issues for the team was available.  I just enjoyed resolving the issues for the customers in a timely manner. If you think you’re gonna come into this job being paid what you’re worth, think again. Just like any other job that want to pay younrhe least and work you the most. A company that has structural problems, they provide a high amount of small perks like free soda, but have a culture where it is implied that things are so fun there's no need for more money or advancement. One of the coolest places I've worked based solely on the work culture. No one really hassles me about my work and as long as it's done on time it's cool. Groupon is an excellent company to work for to get your foot in the door and to start off your career, however, other than cool track jackets for 2 year & 5 year employees, there isn't much of a reason to really stay at the company. Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable, they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets.  This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews, but there isn't incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth.  I came to this company for the experience, with the understanding that this wasn't going to be a long-term company to stick around with, and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.  However, it is not a place to have longer than a five year plan, unless they work on ways to incentivize tenure and compensate based off of skill set and duties. Groupon is an energetic company, and they provide a great number of ways to earn groupon credit, to shop on Groupon. Groupon provides incentives for overtime. Tons of opportunities for people who want to learn, grow, and challenge themselves. Openness to new ideas/solutions. Has the resources and support of a global organization with the feel of a startup.  But the people are just the best, which you will hear from basically anyone you ask. Humble, funny, helpful folks everywhere. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Great company, great people to work with, but again, the same issues all tech companies tend to face - work/life balance is pretty minimal, all of our focus is on work, not life. fast paced work environment  good atmosphere and great management ,treat employees right  and do a lot of things for them,i would give them a go you wont regret it Learning about push notifications and how it can be optimized to cater to customers in the most relevant way. Great employees and people to work with but some of management lack professionalism great pay and benefits long breaks and lots of overtime must work fast and well with others have to keep your production rate up at all times I felt Groupon was a bit unprofessional and relied heavily on management decisions without employee imput. There was also a great deal of micromanaging at the company that made working difficult there. The last three years I have been provided additional support to further my career. This is my favorite part, they do teach and spend extra time with employees to build them up. This is a great job to get sales experience on a corporate level.  Young, inexperienced managers, make it tough to advance and turn into a career. High turnover, Executive Assistants should be paid a higher salary as when I was working there, I was on call 24/7.  I had to ask for the raises instead of them being offered to me for the hard work I put in They are very unorganized cannot keep employees. had a lot of lost orders. Felt like I was not important to the company. This job included picking,packing and finding missing/aged orders. Was a great entry level sales position.  Very cut throat and a high turnover for those that aren't successful in the roll.  Unlimited PTO and lots of fun outings. Core sales training. Management and organization changes a lot but flexible people do well and are happy. Positive experience and dynamic environment. This place is stressful, without any growth guarantee and a lack of management. Managers bully their team members into lying to clients to obtain and meet goals. The company sees no problem is underpaying their employees while expecting them to work to the point of burn out. It is a revolving door with no loyalty to its employees. Employees are made to feel replaceable with many looking for other opportunities shortly after beginning with the company. Great knowledgeable people to work with, and super fun workplace.  Company offers a great deal of benefits as well as training. Difficult to move around, but a great place to learn. The best holiday parties ever with great celebrity guest for free!! Just needs better communication between upper management.  Stop outsourcing with very little training. Lots of learning, great sales training and working with some great people. Able to learn Salesforce CRM, work with big brands and learn how to really sell. Great manager and always able to ask questions, very approachable! You had limited support from managers.  We had daily morning meetings which we just spoke about our daily goals.  Also monthly meetings in office.  Other then that we didn't see or speak to our mangers.  Very isolated. The company was not worker-oriented. The company I worked for owned by Groupon was sold with only 30 days notice. We were promised to be hired by the company merging with mine, but I and many of my coworkers' applications were never considered. This caused a lot of emotional and financial distress. Groupon has had some growing pains over the years, but the company seems pointed in the right direction. New 401K match for employees shows management is serious about maintaining employees for the long term. I would be doing something different every day. I loved working at Groupon. I loved when I was a cycle counter. I went around and counted all the project. Also loved driver power industrial trucks. A typical day at Groupon you are there 9am-5pm although hours may vary depending on role. Each employee has a laptop so you are able to work from home if needed.  Groupon is a very young culture, with an average age of employees in their mid 20s. Managers and executives tend to be a bit older in their 30s-40s. It is awesome to work for a company that is growing so quickly and on the forefront of technology trends. However, because Groupon grew so quickly from the start they change strategy quite often. The new CEO does seem to have a long term strategy for Groupon which is comforting. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to run your own business with very few limitations or people saying 'no' to you. The hardest part of the job is getting vendors and suppliers to see Groupon as a retailer and not a discounter. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Good luck getting promoted if your not best friends with your manager.  They seem to think you need 5 years of experience before your ready for a management role. I enjoyed working for Groupon. Its a company with young, motivated individuals that support one another. Overall, my job was stressful due to the nature of my position and job responsibilities. Repetitive daily tasks. Constantly encountering the same issues and concerns as if it were Ground Hog's day. Data is challenging to work with. Not a friendly environment. morning  meeting with team every work day to go pervious days number and accuracy %, highest counter,..provide team with vendor bucks to buy this from the vending machine for top counter and outstanding inventory finds.work with all department to meet requested needs for online orders. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Groupon in the environment it was when I left.  That was over 3 years ago though so I'm not sure if anything has changed. working for Groupon was a great experience and an over all awesome  learning experience. i couldn't have asked for a better internship that gave me the knowledge that i now have. Love working at Groupon! I would recommend it to anyone I know. It is a great stepping stone in my career. They are very kind and it is a fun place to work. at this point probably hard to start new there and make the kind of money you want. management doesnt care about you, you are just a number to them. as soon as u start making good money, they somehow force you out Management doesn't pay attention to you or help you grow, solely numbers focused. Very rigorous environment, however, if you're doing really well, life can be very easy. Groupon is a great company to work for.   They reward for hard work and dedication but believe in work/family balance.   The Corporate office was laid  back with pool table, tiki. bar and swings.   Groupon is well run and offers a lot of training and skill development. Pros:- NothingCons:-Unprofessional Management-Immature co workers that act like they're in a sorority/ fraternity-Gossip 24/7-poor pay-No recognition-No career advancement-A lot of politics involved -Feels like a cult-You're treated as a number and not a human being-They will get rid of you as fast as they brought you in-Can't approach management or director of sales with any issue, they just shut you down.-Training is just busy work.-Unlimited time off must be requested in advance-No flex time or allowed to work from home Groupon takes care of its management. The compensation structure is very top heavy. The staff, seniors, and other employees who work hard every day to ensure that profits are rolling in are not included in the bonus structure. Additionally, they are compensated well below the industry average.Management is looking for people who are overly qualified and have three years of accounting experience to settle for a salary of $55k, yet are astonished when no one wants to take the position. The Company needs to invest in its people more in order to avoid horrendous turnover. Groupon started out as a great company.  It cared about the city, it cared about its employees, it cared about its customers.  Now?  It's a shell of what it used to be.  It's money hungry, creatively stifled, and hemorrhaging talent and funds like nobodies business.  I expect Groupon to be the next Enron. Management was very supportive and encouraging. My bosses were very easy to communicate with and they were genuine people. Unfortunately, my department was eliminated and there was no way to avoid being laid off. They laid us off when they partnered with grubhub. The supervisors were power-high and inefficient. Working remotely was cool but the work was daunting. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone mainly because the position no longer exists. Used to be a great place to work and I would normally recommend, but the past few years they have cut quality and laid off tons of US employees.  Operations are now overseas the but service is trash Very loud call center environment. Ping Pong, free soda, good location, good training. Very high turnover, fun job if you love cold calling, consultative type style of selling. poor communication, lay-offs are rampent, managers are terrible, upper management does whatever they want no matter who/what it effects, no clue how to run a business If you enjoy working in an environment of stress and mismanagement, then this is the place for you.No one knows what they are doing. Period. It’s a chaotic mess. Not a fair job for outside sales. Chicago based employees have an advantage. No opportunity for growth. The company changes rules very quickly which makes sales a moving target. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. It was great at first. I guess I started at a good time when the commission structure was awsome,  then it changed, and changed all within a 9 month span. It got to where I was making half of what i was when I started. Not to mention the ever changing progression structure. IDK. it's just hard selling a product that no one likes. - Great place to start your career- Great training and cold calling experience- Bad Management - When you're eligible for promotion doesn't mean you will be - Hard to advance- Terrible base pay Good people, less stressful, some management issues. Raises are not predictable and some people get to be promoted for a reason that   is not clear to the rest of the staff. Pay is average I felt cut off. It was hard to interact with other since I was at home and there was limited contact with my manager. I enjoyed not having a commute. I did not like how they laid off everyone without any notice. Groupon is a workplace where job tasks change constantly with the potential of being laid off. I learned more about the pace of corporate America along with the level of unorganised leadership in this particular company. Although Groupon Customer Service has been a apart of my life for the last 2 1/2 years, I really enjoyed working in the Getaways department. A typical day at work would consist of me being a liaison between the customers and hotel management to resolve reservation issues.During my time here, I've learned to multi-task effectively, find multiple routes to resolve issues, and adapt quickly to change. Our management department(s) had gone through several changes over the past 2 years. However, management remained consistent in being a informative, and dependable source when needed.  My position was remote, which was the best and the hardest part of my job at times. Working from home had major benefits such as saving money on transportation, and me being able to spend more time with my son. However, there were times when I thought being in office, would provide more resources, and aid me in elevating within the company. The most enjoyable part of my job was the Customer Service chat rooms. Us representatives were able to consult with our managers, and one another, concerning customer issues, conflict resolution,  and our daily lives. It helped many of us feel like we were a part of the overall team, and was a huge help for the challenges we faced at work.I also enjoyed  the semi-monthly seminars our Development Team hosted. These seminars provided information on a wide range of topics including how to deal with issues in customer service, how to build your own brand, and how to stand out within the company. Both the Customer Service chat rooms, and the semi-monthly  seminars,  were critical towards representatives professional growth and development. Beware this company will lay you off out of the blue. No warning at all.Just BAM...no job.. Pay is decent if you dont have rent and bills. best thing there are the coworkers fun place to work but lacks in comp and advancement a lot of callscold callsmicro managed unrealistic goalsthe office will be closing soon no advancement with closing office Overall I enjoyed working for the company. However I was not happy at the fact they laid us off and knew months in advance they were going to do so. They should have informed us so that we could have made plans to look for new jobs. Instead they outsourced, had us training the agents and informed us in case of an overflow of business due to the upcoming hurricane. Can't say enough good things about Groupon.  The working environment was so energizing that everyday was a new adventure.   If you work hard, you get to play hard (occasional free lunch-ins, happy hours with your department, etc).  For sales, sometimes the metrics that they measured would change on a weekly basis. But other then that, awesome experience and people. I was working at Groupon when they were going through significant growth and pressure. It was a mess: leadership was disorganized and they strategized poorly. This instability created an erratic work experience. I can only imagine the company (and market) has 'right-sized', recognizing a more realistic competitive strategy and a humbler view of themselves. This sort of stability will, I'm sure, make the company a more attractive place to work.Outside of that, it was a typical inside sales job. Definitely a lot of pressure to preform, but it wasn't exactly boiler room. If you're interested in a career in sales (but more likely are just coming out of college with few skill and are looking for a job), this is a fine place to start, and probably better than when I was there. nice place to work ; they never had the right tools to work with like no boxes to pack the merchandise are you stand on your feet 12 hours and sometime you work 7 days straight over work pro the people was nice to everyone and for your hard work you got nice gift, Join a gym, because you'll be at a desk 40 hours a week. My TL was great. He assisted with any issues I encountered. The training needs to be beefed up. I enjoyed the experience Groupon provided a fun and exciting atmosphere to work in while also creating an environment that rewards excellent performance and encourages and trains everyone to accomplish their goals. Groupon, does an exceptional job on work and life balance. However, the job security is quite hairy at times. They tend to eliminate positions on a whim. Finally, the higher level executives, have poor leadership and tend to not take suggestions from personnel very well. Overall, I would give them a good rating but need to work on some things. Groupon was the best Job I ever had in my life. I work there as a temp . I wish it could've been more permanent. The environment was very fun and it made you excited to coming to work every day. The office was very colorful as well. In general, the company doesn't seem to have a clear cut plan of action. Needs to figure out their direction. I love their products and would like to see them take that to a new level. From the outside, one would think of Groupon as a very good company. However, once you start working there you'll realize how much management doesn't care about it's people. They feel that you can easily be replaced. You never truly feel comfortable there because they will find a way to get rid of you. It's only a matter of time. Keep your resume active because your gonna need it sooner than later. They will fire you. it's simply a matter of when. Working in the Chicago office was a great experience and there were many perks in the office, such as ping pong, pool, xbox and free beverages.  The downfall would be sitting on the phones all day. They want everything from their employees and give nothing in return. They will tell you that you are working a 40 hour week but will send you home in 30 or if it is busy they will say you are working a 8 hour shift and tell you during the business day that they changed it to an 12 hour and if you refuse to stay they will point you. Even though they did not post OT the day before I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Great place to start your career but do not think of it as a long term solution. My best advice is to get experience and move on. You will make life long friends. I'd only suggest working for this company if you're looking for a quick pay. The energy is good in the start but it spirals down slowly and makes you reconsider working. I enjoyed working here in the beginning but the constant changes were unremorseful. The tactics were unrealistic to relay to the customers. Worked at Groupon for a year now and enjoyed it as a first job out of college however, there isn't a whole lot to keep you there. A lot of turnover and difficulty to switch departments. Great company for those looking for a first job out of college. Pay is on the lower end but the experience is worth it. Would work there again if the pay was adequate great coworkers, great environment, great problems to solve a lot of immature manager and still trying to figure out the opportunity and what it all Intel. Not a lot of clear direction or incentive to thrive with the company. Pay plans was changed three time in my tenure with the company. the company is good overall not a unified company. the unlimited pto is a great option. but not all managers are equipped for the responsibility alot of merritt due to friendships and not skill level. I liked Groupon they have a nice indoor&outdoor break room. They also have a playroom, but that place is filled with drama. And they always go by the he said she said. Its like high school all over again. While the compensation was great for Groupon, everything else did not measure up.  As a manager they expected 60+ hours a week from you and they did not work with you when it came to your work/life balance. Groupon is a young company with young employees. Management does not guide and mentor teams like they should.  The laid back mentality of the office leads to people not being accountable. There isn't a lot of opportunity for advancement. Multitasking skills were necessary. Picked, packed, inspected, manifested for shipping, printed shipping labels, palatalized and shrink wrapped products. The company is great.  You can make a huge impact with less red tape; however, you're expected to be available 24 hours/day.  There wasn't a Christmas I didn't work 4 hours and pay didn't make up for it. I was hired to work from home as a customer service representative. There was very little appropriate training before I, and many others, were put to work. Once we started working, the only time we had with our managers was via live conference with our group of others under our manager. We were an “experimental” group, and it showed. I loved this role - every manager I had was great and I was promoted from within.The culture was great and the customer service team was very supportive. It's a fun company and the culture is great. You will work very hard and work is mostly independent. Unfortunately, most position changes are considered lateral moves. painfully lacking in direction.  very young staff with little/no experience.  Zero management direction.   Strategic planning typically looks out only 2 weeks. Unpredictable changes at any moment - there is no job security whatsoever. Lazy staff is kept around while hard working people are laid off. Internal corporate changes made without any plans. Many people do not see a long term outlook for this company. Great company to work for. Great benefits  great pay. Managers and supervisors are all great. Def would recommend someone working here if they were looking for job Nice office with ping pong table, fusball, free soda, fooda, cafeteria, enchanted forest and the space cat. Good view of the Hancock tower. Nice people around. Groupon has a great environment in which to work. The sales positions are very hard to master and keep. Lots of turnover due to personal performance and company performance as well I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. I, personally, enjoyed my experience at Groupon. I did not agree with the poor compensation for the amount of work that was put in. Cultivated great relationships in a well-rounded, relaxed culture. Extensive training program was an 'A' in my book. working at Groupon was great.  I had a great work environment. Management was very helpful and easy to work with. Groupon thought me how to enhance my customer service skills and be better at the job I do. This company has their favorites and promotes the wrong people who are not fit. I liked the culture and people who worked there. The job itself it fine, lots of hand-holding. Fun place to work. Make nice money. Meet lots of people. Lots of social events outside of work hours for team building that are really fun. Casual dress code. If you are fresh out of college, with no responsibilities just yet, this is the place for you.  Ping Pong tables, free coffee, pool tables, video games, etc.  If you have a family, home life, children, etc.  This is not the ideal position for you. A typical day involves learning to lead gen and vet proper accounts, call prospects, and ideally set yourself up for success. Closing contracts and GP are going to the most important on paper, but learning the sales process and how not only to sell, but market to businesses and merchants will help you fully in this job. call center life is not the life for an educated person.  I feel underutilized and therefore am looking to relocated to a new employer asap.  I know I am more valuable than what I am able to show due to the remedial position I currently hold. Always loved it here - looking for a change - would love to take what I have learned at this company and apply it else where. groupon is certainly one of a kid and I will miss it. But I'm looking for more and to learn more. Educate myself more. nothing bad to say.  Good company to work for, just very stressful.  If you don't mind hearing about daily metrics until your head explodes, this job can be very rewarding. Great work environment, supportive, young and hungry. Management was very willing to step in and help.  You worked in a setting that allowed for collaboration. Good place for a day job while pursuing an artists life.I learned saleforce and excel.Management is varied. Some great some not so great.Relaxed environment.Pay is not commiserate with the work.Flexible schedule and unlimited time off. Groupon has really diversified their business after a rough IPO launch. Tons of young employees, so you can understand why the operating profit was an issue for years until the recent management decided to find other avenues for revenue. Groupon has the ability to become a powerful force in customer acquisition, as well as fantastic consumer destination, but they are definitely focused on the numbers after a dismal start on the market. With that said, the business is on the upswing. Hard to advance. Not transparent. Fun activities. Great people. Recommend for right out of college. Great office location. Love Chicago, can make a lot of money but most people don't. The job wasn't challenging and was told to 'JUST TO YOUR JOB' when asked if I could take on more tasks.  Job opportunity for job advancement what so ever. Very great company, wonderful work environment with many friendly people. Work compensation could us some improvement. Groupon is a great to place to work! I love the work/life balance they provide. What I love most about the job is that everyday is different. Working at Groupon provided me with great experience out of college. It's an extremely fast-paced, ever-changing environment that tests your ability to adapt. Groupon PR, was a fast paced, enjoyable work environment, with helpful co-workers and management. enjoyed working their due to the fact that bringing in deals in every market possible, gives you he chance o learn about a lot of different  business their strategies. I have enjoyed working with this company over the years. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The teams I have worked on have always been flexible with family situations and very understanding. Work is busy as soon as you log in, and stays busy till you log off. Phone lines close at 8pm CST, and open at 8am. Management review your work on a weekly basis, and discuss areas of improvement and what you are doing exceptional at. Doing this without making you feel belittled. Co-workers are great people to work with. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Limited growth opportunities in the greater Kansas City area, great perks for products and services offered by merchants. Great customer guarantee on services and products. The office is very cool. The people are all very fun and young. The company will also put on some very cool parties. Everything is great except for the job itself. Selling solely over the phone is not for everyone. It is quite repetitive and with a product like this you can often times find yourself getting cussed out by potential clients. Uma empresa multinacional com um potencia imenso no trabalho em grupo, com uma gestão fantástica. Groupon is an OK company to work for. Towards the end of my employment I felt as if they were picking with me due to the complications i had during my pregnancy. Hours were flexible, but coworkers were always ready to work. The company culture was great. I learned about the company, salesforce, and copywriting. I loved working at Groupon - the people were fantastic and the vibe was fun. The co-workers were some of the best people I know and loved working with all of the people that I met. This is a great place to work. There is a lot of talent here. I've been here for two years and my stint has come to a close as we closed the NYC offices. There is so much to learn and most employees are thoughtful, etc. Company is going through a bit of re-structuring right now (December 2016) - so there is some change the organization through out. Lot's of cash in the bank and my hope they power through this ordeal.Overall this is a great company to work for as long as they keep doing what they do... Working for Groupon I learned that you always have to be at a fast pace to get orders out on time. Our leaders are always there to help anytime. hardest part about working there I have to say the young kids doing peek Nothing bad to say about Groupon. Great for young adults fresh out of college that need direction. Feels like a frat house at times. Work life balance great. Lacks transparent career paths. Best job I ever had,had a few days where I had to work several days straight, but it was worth it. Really good people to work with an dependon, had things there to help with. Groupon is a fun place to work. It is easy to get to, and an easy place to make friends. People who work in Image Design are typical tech/startup personalities, with active lifestyles, hobbies, and high levels of competence. Image designers have relatively flexible schedules, but are required to meet a certain average productivity level, which is measured on a digital meter, so work sometimes feels like a game to get enough points in. At first, it is hard to get in all the points, but you soon learn how to work quickly and effectively. Groupon has many social groups you can join, as well as athletic activities. There is free coffee, free vitamin water, and sometimes free snacks.There is a game room, a swingset, a crying area, a DJ in the elevator, and a giant cat in a spaceship. Compensation was terrible ($13 hourly) but morale was great. Its a really great gig for recent graduates or people just moving to the city. Working at Groupon is by no means terrible. You will have a comfortable job, but most likely few challenges that utilize your education or skills. Most days I did the exact same thing, over and over again, down to the button click. This is why I eventually became bored and had to leave. There is room for advancement, but you have to be able to get through the monotonous entry level jobs before pursuing that, which proved difficult. Management leaves a little to be desired, but it was a very young company when I worked there. Chances are they've improved since then. There are a lot of great pros to working for Groupon too - flex scheduling, relaxed environment, and of course the other amazing staff members. Each day is challenging at my position, i am called on to solve issues that are barriers or obstructions to production needs.I have learned a great deal about warehousing and it's challenges that change almost daily.I have been tasked to guide and mentor many of the management staff due to my diverse career experiences.Many of my coworkers are much younger and i have worked to develop good relationships to help the team accomplish production goals.The most difficult part of my job has been to manage so many different teams and provide them all the tools needed to be successful at their goals by convincing corporate finance to invest in better tools.The most enjoyable part of my job has been when my Team has been successful at accomplishing it's goal and i could see where my involvement and assistance was part of that success. It was great in the beginning then it all went south.  Poor work life balance, poor management.  Lots of internal politics. Great potential but have many process changes instituted and changed again before seeing full benefits. Spur of the moment decisions affecting long term goals. You will have to come to work day in and day out ready for the challenges of sales via telephone or email but you are surrounded by people who are willing to help in a high energy work space. This a company has great sales managers, good people, but after a while, the product gets old to sell.  No restaurant is a fan of Groupon, making it extremely hard to sell.  It's easy to get burnt out, but not as easy as logistic sales positions. I had a wonderful time working for this company.  The people were fun and the atmosphere was friendly.  Additionally you get a certain amount of freedom when it comes to setting up deals.  As long as those deals conform to groupon's requirements they will be accepted.  More often than not you are helping companies to grow and you will be thanked by those companies if the groupon sells well.  I would recommend this job to anyone who has phone sales experience and is looking for a fun and challenging atmosphere. I enjoyed working for Groupon nc from February 2015 til August 2016. Although they could have more room for growth, it's a cool company to work for I love that my schedule is pretty flexible and I feel supported by current management. Great, happy environment. Lots of natural light and company laptops for FT employees. Game room and many food options. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Ive worked here coming up on 4 yrs.  I enjoy it very much.  There is a great culture here and if savvy and a hard worker you can definitely make money.  I just wish they paid managers better as this discourages people from applying for that title While Groupon has a variety of offerings from yoga classes to sailing excursions, a person who is adept at working with restaurateurs will do quite well here. The overall management structure is extremely chaotic, and there is a great deal of turnover. This makes it very challenging to have business partners in other departments (legal, for example) when trying to execute contracts, etc. If you are an engineer or upper management or an HR representative, job security and pay grade is good, life is great, for anyone else, life sucks. This company is still very young in the goods aspect.  They are constantly making changes and pushing the boundaries to ensure they business is not stagnate.Due to it being a logistics company, there is no consistency with your schedule.  It tends to change on a daily basis and even worse for the management.The managers on the floor are a tight knit group and work well in ensuring the goal is met daily.  They cover for each other when they need off or vacations. Although things can be stressful during the peak season, last year was 41 days straight the associates and managers worked to ensure the customer orders were all fulfilled by the time guaranteed. Best part of my job, is my fellow managers and the team that works for me.  They make all the sacrifices worth it! When we arrive on a job we work together as Team. We do not Play around everyone played there position and we get the job done,we would laugh and have fun at lunch time. I enjoy every day. it's good to work and fun by solving challenging problems. It's quite fun at pool table where we discuss our problems and come up with solutions there. The worst organization I have ever worked at . The management is so careless and no skills in running a business and it shows in their market results clearly. If you don't know anything about e-commerce this is a good company to learn e-commerce.  They are still trying to figure out company culture and direction. Groupon provides a nice work life balance, and friendly people.  And given the size of its business, enables one to work on many things. The many layers of management makes it at time difficult to achieve progress and politics often become involved in any decision making. Groupon is an exceptional company to build lasting professional relationships and gain quality business/e-commerce exposure.  Unfortunately, the company largely views people as replaceable and allows politics and at times short term goals to dictate strategic decisions. Groupon has had a reputation for being a fun and forward-thinking place to work. They outgrew themselves, though, and outgrew all that.PROs: The people you work with will be the highlight of the job. Management seems genuinely invested in your well-being. Also, free beverages all day.CONs: It has turned very corporate, the small folks have small importance. There is no transparency from the top. Also, this is now the type of place where you're assured you're doing an awesome job one day and show up (literally) the next day to find your position eliminated. Expectations are unfocused and non realistic. The main focus is ways to give the higher management praise over backing the work ethic/ policies set forth for the front-line and management teams. Each department is so detached that it is difficult to foresee longevity. Overall b+ loved the staff, product and Customers. It was also great to see the customers so happy once the solution was in place. Really friendly people, great  work environment. Very fun place to work and you can move up rather quickly. Also had a great christmas party! So, I was a remote worker with Groupon for almost a year. I had some internet issues, and my production fell below the number they'd like to see so I got canned. The support you get from Groupon management and other employees while you're working from home is awesome. You have a Team Chat room you can discuss things in or bounce problems off your teammates. The management was really helpful if you should have tech issues involving their software or equipment... I'd love to work for them again, someday if my internet situation changes. I thoroughly enjoyed working at Groupon as a temp. I was well trained on new systems, and I always felt comfortable seeking help. At the same time I was given autonomy in accomplishing my daily and weekly tasks. My managers worked hard at creating a fun work environment and made it a priority to check-in on me consistently. Strong sales training. Like most entry sales jobs, it is a sink or swim setting. Strong support from management that is willing to help out employees. - Fun environment- They hire awesome people that mesh well together- Constantly working to be better their employees- Cold Calling quotas- Fun work events I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Constant changes in performance metrics, clueless 'managers,' little  tier 2 support. It's like someone went to a dorm and hired everyone there for their first big boy job. There are some good people here but they are highly outnumbered by the loud morons. The most unprofessional workplace I have ever seen. Good place to work because of great people. Great people make great companies. Fun atmosphere, 8-5 M-F, nice office, kitchen with beverages (hot & cold), small game room. Management always supportive, coaching, helps out on calls when needed. Daily smiling & dialing job. Strenuous training program, with no relevance to the product or services and entirely focused on the methodologies of selling the 'Groupon way'. Very high turn-over rate. Competitive work environment, with sales staff calling on same territory/leads. No room for advancement, unless you are based in the Chicago, IL headquarters. Focus on what's best for Groupon and not it's clients. Churn and burn sales process, with no real relationship building, because accounts are constantly being reassigned to new AEs. Management is very well put together and organized. Feels like a revolving door as new faces are always coming and going. Writing this from my desk, I really wish I never came here. Unless you enjoy cold calling really terrible, really rude businesses and attempting to sell them a broken product that the rest of the business industry doesn't see going anywhere, go work at Starbucks. With the $32,500 pay they offer, you'd probably make more there anyway. I appreciated Groupon because it gave me the opportunity to sharpen my Qa skills.  I also learned how to work with API/JSON. The work culture and everyone you work with are really great and you'll enjoy coming to work to be around these people. But the pay is extremely low and sometime your just a number there. Management cares for employees well being. Must be comfortable with constant change. Most outside sales positions are work from home so must be a self starter. Typical sales position, high volume cold calling, emailing and pounding the pavement. If you work hard you can make decent money. This has been a great place to work for with wonderful and caring people.  I learned a whole new operation system on my won.  People were helpful when they could be. I enjoy woking here and the people are nice.  Welcoming.  It's very fast-paced which is fine but I was thrown in.  Learned things fast, on my own and now would like some more challenges.  :) One of the best companies to work for in Bay Area. I have worked here for almost 1.5 years now and I am very happy with the overall team and company Have fun while it lasts.  I would not plan on making this a long-term commitment, but it is a great place to learn for an entry-level position Groupon is a growing company that still has the startup feel and mentality. If you like change, you'll love Groupon. Co-workers are awesome, managers are young but good, you'll work hard here because you need to. Great place to work that will work with your schedule, sometimes you want to go the extra step for customers and policies will not allow you to. It's a fast paced work areas where management should haven't been managing.co workers are greathardest partest is the job itselfmost enjoyable part is closing deals. Great Company to work for, the benefits are wonderful, and the people are great to work with. I have been given the opportunity to grow in my job, and learn more everyday. Although the party did end, I met plenty of great people & comedians and had plenty of memorable experiences thanks to the company. Typical day at work was like any work day, Floor supers would work with you and help in any way possible. the learning experience was fair and easy with 2 weeks of training. other co workers was helpful, but the hardest part of the job was the long hours. most enjoyable part of the job was the well equipped break room for lunches and they also provided lunch meals from time to time Great people but upper management can be frustrating, office is always stocked with snacks and drinks. Systems and processes are very manual. Great team, flat environment, transparent managers and always a lot to learn from other teams as long as you keep you receptors open. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Talented engineers, great team spirit, projects are consumer focused, fast paced and make big impact. Great place for self starters. Work-life balance may not be great at times, projects can be stressful with changing priorities. The company's growth plan is not clear. Awesome work environment, Management is helpful and knowledgeable. Fun place to work! Many advancement opportunities if willing to put in the time and effort, Groupon is a fun place to work if you love customer service and dealing with more than 50 phone calls per day.  This is a fast paced work assignment that requires you to type, listen, communicate effectively and complete the customers request with a limited time frame. While the work/life balance and company culture are enough to get them to keep you there, the day-to-day job can get boring. You have to really be passionate about sales in order to thrive. Groupon is a very cool place to start your career. I learned how to conduct myself in a corporate setting. My time spent here has been nothing but positive. Result-driven environment. Less concerned with what you look like or what you wear and more interested in the skills and drive you possess. Great entry-level position. Groupon is a fun, young company that encourages employees to connect with each other and help each other grow. It has a young management team, which can lead to increased politics at times, unstable org chart, and constant changes to internal structure due to juvenile-like decision making It's a relaxed atmosphere, where you work hard. The people there are very friendly and easy to get along with. I've definitely learned a lot about Excel and how to manage my time well. Management is young, which makes it easier to relate to them. The hardest part of the job at the beginning was working in cubicles to open floor seating. Infrequent meetings and poor working conditions. Would not recommend this job to anyone interested in the healthcare industry. Really fun company to work for. Lot's of benefits and compensation is good. However the management there was pretty bad, and they go around firing whole teams out of the blue. It was a great place to work, I got a lot of experience. I learned how to put data into the system and update the inventory. I learned how to audit the receivers. How to research inventory locations and find lost items. How to problem solve mistakes made in the system. I learned how to use a pallet jack and an RF gun and put away pallets of products. My supervisor and managers were great and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning how to fix other peoples receiving mistakes in the system. The most enjoyable part was getting to learn everything, and be as helpful as I can to the company. Great new workplace with supportive and helpful PA's for new young hires. Moved around all the different parts of the warehouse to learn the process of receiving through shipping, and everything in between!! Great first job!! Really fun office with great, young people. This is an energetic office and it definitely makes for a competitive atmosphere. If you're solely looking for sales experience, which I was, Groupon is the place to do it. As fun as it can be, at the end of the day it is a sales role, and if you don't hit your numbers they will not hesitate to terminate you. Fun place, good life work balance, encourage job advancementA LOT OF WORK, young culture, no respect for chain of command - The people are great, I don't think management has the backs of employees often. It is nice to really have a positive impact on how features go, but situations like that are few and far between Working at Groupon helped me further garnish knowledge of Sales as a whole.  Long hours are required in this job.  The people and relationships you build at the company are fantastic. Groupon is a very cool place to start your career. I learned how to conduct myself in a corporate setting. My time spent here has been nothing but positive. Upper and Middle management do not communicate clearly together, and management styles and metrics vary from manager to manager.  One manager tells you your doing great, then you get transfered to another manager who fires you with no prior warnings or notices about job performance.  This is not a joke, it happened to several members of my team.  There is no relief from calls at all, this place is SEVERELY understaffed for the volume they handle and you are expected to not only manage calls immediately after the previous, but also do projects and work emails simultaneously.  There is no clear direction here.  No one communicates.  If you have a computer issue with their provided computers, the policy says it does not count against you, but they count it against you and you basically work emails or projects for days while waiting for IT to maybe stumble across your ticket.  They have a great culture if people would embrace it though.  They pay in office staff more than at home employees who do the same job.  I had a friend in office who started a week after me who made $5.50 more than me hourly. •	Generate and expand relationships with assigned customers and prospects to maximize revenue opportunities and minimize customer cancellations.•	Consult with these customers to determine the business needs and the best utilization the products and services offered.•	Prioritize assigned customer list and Dealer Service to focus on revenue potential•	Ensure billed revenue is collected within designated time frame.•	Build strong relationships with the Owners and General Managers within the dealership to ensure time is spent with decision makers who can approve ad spend for products and services being purchased and resolve issues in a timely manner.•	Determine, in consultation with the customer, the best product combinations for each assigned account based on a customer needs analysis.•	Use Customer Relationship Management system to track progress and identify opportunities for revenue and service Groupon is a growing company that offers a great product. The culture is pretty amazing and there are some exceptional perks to working in the Seattle office. (fully stocked break room)Majority of the management team has come from Amazon and so are the employees. The largest team is the marketing team and a typical is not typical.  Everyday there's something new going on with different challenges. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. It is has a startup feel and a great place to start your career. Lots of opportunities still but the benefits are pretty bad. Good work/life balance and company could do better to incentivize and reward employees. There is a lot of opportunity to make a big impact. You wear many hats on the job. Needs to work on safety and security. Much to lean in the warehouse. The management are new and need to work on there job culture. I've been working at Groupon for the past two years in Outside Sales.A terrible place to work. Very unstable. I've had 5 Managers in two years. The sales quotas constantly change without warning. There are no new sales programs for us to offer merchants. The commission structure is terrible. Deals are not selling as well as previously. very unique work environment, can be a bit heavy on the micro managing side of things. Very fast paced, very diverse, work stations rotate regularly to keep things upbeat. Groupon likes to hire fresh college students that are not aware of what they should be paid for the amount of work for which they are held accountable.  Certain VP's have said in large meetings, 'Your chair is more valuable than you are' and 'I don't care if you like the product, if you're not selling it we don't need you'.Not always the most enthralling place to work for an experienced person. The days can be very long and can be very rewarding. I learned sales techniques that were effective and applicable to other aspects of my life. The Groupon culture is unlike any other and is extremely fulfilling. It is full of highs and lows; it takes a lot of strength to remain even-keeled. I loved my coworkers and the motivations we received as a team. Beginning at 9am and reviewed the queries of customers , I attend complaints by phone and then take bookings per system.Vouchers and tasks performed aftermarket . Really enjoyed working here, free breakfast, snacks, drinks etc. Very young, fast paced and super fun place to work at. Weekly bbqs, small teams, well balanced work loads. Groupon used to be great, but those days are over. Compensation plans are CONSTANTLY changing, the only consistent aspect of the comp is that its always sub-par from any relative industry standards. The company has become a terrible place to work, employees are continually growing more and more disillusioned, management adheres to a activity metrics driven environment over results. I work on the groupon travel sales team partnering with hospitality management groups to bring them incremental business. I have really enjoyed working for groupon. I have learned a lot from my co-workers and supervisor. They have allowed me to challenge myself. The experience is priceless and I have learned how to maintain relationships with clients and franchises. Lead sales and operations for the Central and Southeast regions.  10 Managers and 145 sales reps.Manage goals and KPIsDrive productionCreate vision for sales organization Everyday is different.  Groupon is constantly changing.  From the site to the internal structure.  To work here you must be willing to go with the flow.Great Benefits, Unlimited time off Coming out of college not a bad first job but there a lot of better companies to work for. The work life balance isn't great but could be much worse. WAs the best work I have ever worked ! WAs very rough but the people and culture were great. The company respect your personality. A typical day on my job consist of starting my day with greeting my co workers as they come through the gate, then I would inspect my forklift, fill out the check list....and head to the morning meeting. From there I would get my daily pick sheet and begin picking orders. As a inventory clerk my day consist of calling clients to verify their orders are correct and match it with our inventory. I would receive inventory and count them to verify the product amount matches with what we had on our system and store the product once the inventory is performed.As a secretary I did a lot of heavy filing and phone calls. I would call clients regarding their order to verify delivery date or pick up. Groupon does a great job at having a training program that feels like college all over again, they do this to hide the fact that once you get out of it there is little job security, no money to be made, and you are constantly micromanaged. You will get a few emails a day from your boss who sits right next to you to do better, then a couple G-chats asking if you can commit to doing better, then finally a meeting or two where you will be asked to do more.The 'senior' salespeople hate the job, but can't leave it because they are making easy money, the new salespeople have to grind 10 hours a day everyday to pick up the scraps of businesses no one else cared about because they won't make money. As far as job security goes there is none, as it is cheaper to make the work environment terrible for new people so they quit, rather than actually investing in them and foster a comfortable work environment to encourage people to stay.At Groupon there are two segments of people, people who got in before the bubble popped on making money (2 or more years) and the never ending rotation of people who quit prior to making it one year.This job is horrible. Run. Awesome Company to work for with great management! It's a very young environment and makes work feel less like work and more like a college campus. Open floor plan made it even better to interact with different teams and departments I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Fun atmosphere. No real dress code. High activity driven sales. Don't miss your monthly sales quota. Great entry level job, but compensation could be better. Be open to changes, as they will happen every other day as the company is still young and trying to grow. Customer service work isn't the most stimulating job in the world, but Groupon did a great job making us feel comfortable and motivated. The office culture was relaxed, the management was accessible, and the coffee was bottomless. I love the idea of Groupon, but the company as a whole lacks accountable leadership at just about every level. Don't come here hoping to be in a great company. Most of the leadership is very young and lacks leadership, people skills and experience.There are people that care and work hard but you are on your own most of the time with very little support. They often will not back fill positions for months on end so they can look better on paper for quarterly reports. This causes huge support gaps for our customers and creates frustration among employees and customers. They have paid me late several times and still owe thousands in back compensation. Just a bad experience over-all unfortunately. fun place to work and you could really meet some amazing people, but it's hard to sell a product that the majority just do not want in a constrained time frame. A typical day at work was having a few meetings throughout the day to discuss current projects, any rollout issues, bug fixes, new improvement requests, and making sure everyone is on task for the project to be completed on time and perfectly. Lots of room to move into different positions. Most mid-upper level management are Senior employees with little experience managing people. Also very poor communication of requirements/goals.Coworkers are great, open minded individuals. Toughest part of the job is company-wide poor change management. Most enjoyable part is unlimited PTO at supervisor's discretion A typical day at Groupon involves the entire sales process. You have the opportunity to generate leads, evaluate a prospect, discover pain points, create/propose a solution, and close all in the same day.I have learned and honed my sales process skills while working at Groupon. The most important quality I have developed is my ability to be consultative in my sales approach.Management allows autonomy provided that you deliver on your monthly goals.Working at Groupon allows you to interact with incredibly intelligent and driven young minds. Having the opportunity to see strategies and ideas from so many different perspectives really helped me grow as a salesperson.The hardest part of the job is finding the opportunity to grow based on the tools provided. The newly adopted business strategies have made it difficult for less-tenured representatives to find success.The most enjoyable part is the culture at the office. The young professionals you get to work with on a daily basis make it easy to come to work every day. A typical day in this warehouse was overall good. I work in the putaway area of the warehouse which meant that I had to take any product from a pack station when something was wrong it such as wrong item or when the quantity didn't match with the system.Then I would scan it out into my badge and take it to the problem solvers. I learned team work, time management, and problem solving skills. Overall experience was very good. I had good experience in dealing with the people and the overall culture was very friendly and supportive. It has great perks like free food, ice-creams, etc. This place made you want to come to work. They played music and allowed you to enter a sweepstakes every so often. They would give away awesome prizes. I liked working with the staff and seeing new product on the floor. Its a great company to work for .But they do have some un realistic goals for their teams to meet . Groupon is a great company with a very rich & fun culture. Some of the toughest parts about the job involve the lack of potential advancement and little pay. Somewhat of a disconnect from outside sells and inside sells reps. On the phones, in front of a computer all day.  Job amenities were great, colleagues and people are great, but some of the management is pretty horrible.  Aside for a select few exemplary individuals who supervised the individual teams, upper managements could care less about their employees as long as they are making money. Have been discriminated and singled out, and also felt under-appreciated for work.  The best part is the overall environment with the people you meet. I only worked here as an intern, which was very interesting because I got the chance to partially see how the marketing business operates. Relaxed work environment. Great place to work for recent grads. Hiring rapidly, firing rapidly, downward spiral all the way around (culture, management, stress) I love working here. The environment is awesome, the people are friendly, and the job is not that difficult. If a part time job with great opportunities is what you want, then Groupon is the way to go,. I absolutely love the work from home aspect of this position. I generally like working for groupon. You have your call quota to make for the day. However, its alot of the same work. I'd like to change it up. As a temporary employee though an agency, theres a disconnect between full-time employees and temp (part-time) workers. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. The people you work with here are the best people. Working in a call center can be mentally and emotionally exhausting, but Groupon is quickly rolling out a work from home program as an attempt to help fight burn out. So many wonderful colleagues and managers. Would have done many things differently. Company is struggling in general, makes it hard to achieve sales goals.  100% remote, little support.  Good base salary. Call, email, close, repeat.  I've learned how to think on my toes - create unique experiences and marketing campaigns for hundreds of small businesses.  I've learned how to handle huge swings - highs and lows - and consistently sell regardless.  The coworkers are great - young company, smart people. Great place to work! Innovative and dynamic environment that is developing, learning and growing in a solid direction. Warehouse Associate at Groupon. •	Industrial duties i.e. cherry picking and packaging items.•	Shipping packages and supplying coworkers with tools for completing assigned duties in a timely manner.•	Provides maintenance on the factory floor to ensure smooth business production Working at Groupon as a Group Fitness Instructor was fun for me. They like the way I kept things fresh and tried new things everyday. They were also very grateful for the knowledge I'd share keeping it very simple to understand. I learned to drive a team is not a strategy that works with a group of people, managing a team is to get them and the strategy every day will evolve to achieve the best result, knower strength and weakness of both to follow a path of continuous improvement. Life is a continuous sale, not just sell a tangible product, but they also are selling an idea, a thought, a plan. Typical sales job making cold calls and trying to close deals to hit sales goals but what makes it unique are the types of accounts you work with and all the young people who work here. Groupon's environment is fantastic. You work with great people. The work life balance is great. They're flexible. It's relaxed. However, it's the only thing that keeps you there - people & comfortability. They now require that you make 35 calls a day which is nothing, but it's how they compare you. They quota you based on points which have 0 compatibility to the amount of profit you make for the company or how good the business is. It's a completely unknown number. They change their goals, mission, outlook, and commission every 2-3 quarters based upon Wall Street. It's senior leadership, specifically on the sales side, is incredibly poor and short sighted. Very good people, but they have no idea how to run a sales force. They reward behavior that shouldn't be rewarded. Most importantly maybe, they have zero clue on long-term outlook. For example, if an employee leaves there is no procedure on accounts, etc. They make decisions without knowing how to manage the rippling effects. Very, very poorly run. If you're a kid out of college go for it. However, they don't know how to develop sales talent/skills, nor retain it. Starting in a new department was a lot of fun. The team grew from 3 to 80 team members in only two years. I've learned how to manage my time and make certain tasks priority over others. The hardest part of the job was constantly adding daily duties to the department. More work lead to less time with client interaction. High call volume was very frustrating as well. Employees were busy with follow up, and had little time to take inbound calls, which makes it difficult on everyone because the call logs get backed up. Management was in meetings all day long and were not around when escalated situations occurred. Sometimes it was a good thing because you make the best decision for that client, and you do your best at coming up with a resolution for the client as well as the company. There was no advancement within the department. Most of the moves with the company were lateral with no additional compensation. I've learned a lot working for a start up company, I don't regret any of it. The managers treat their employees like adults.  They don't micromanage and as long as you get your work done in a timely and efficient manner you can listen to music, shadow other departments and enjoy extended lunch breaks or just take a walk outside!  Everyone is pretty young (23-32) so we are all in the same level it seemed. My daily responsibilities involved handling escalated customer situations either via email or over the phone, coaching and advising direct reports, provided productivity metrics and feedback to individuals. I learned how to communicate effectively, both verbally and written, identify strengths and weaknesses in subordinates, and how to establish beneficial working relationships with constituents on all levels. This place is great for people fresh out of college, but not a place to develop your career as a sales professional. Challenging and Exciting Atmosphere. Fast paced with changes and carrying out the new processes. Great people. This company is fantastic at sales training. However, you will want to move on after a year or two. Groupon is a culture driven, fast paced environment. I would recommend this business. In the two years I worked at Groupon the salesforce was subjected to what seemed like an infinite supply of poorly considered changes.In two years:Commission has changed three times decreasing each time and I've gone from $80k a year in pay to $50k. Goals have changed 4 times from company profit, to company revenue, to company profit, to 'points.' There's a flavor of the month KPI that I would be judged by and I'd never know which is important.I went from loving the first 6 months to this job to becoming so bitter towards sales I'm now leaving at all costs. Groupon is a great company to work for.  The managers care about your success and work with you when you're struggling.  Keep in mind it's still a young company so changes happen frequently. It is pleasure working with Groupon. I learned lot of things in Groupon. I molded myself as a QA by performing all the role of a QA. It made me grow myself in my career. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. This was a great environment just every unorganized. I learned more about working with WMS, RF Scanner and many other thing so I can say that it was a great deal of opportunity to learn many things. There were just shift being switch around like every months. Talk to grumpy customers ALL DAY!!! Quick Training. Fun Coworkers. I have learned the ups and downs of a start up company.  Fun and productive work environment with plenty of room for growth.  Daily challenges and new people are communicated with daily. Great atmosphere to work in, but not much room for advancement excelent company, ecommerce agency, salespersons, CRM systems Groupon sets a fun working environment and allows a lot of freedom. When I joined Groupon I had a thought of what it would be, based on coming from a technology company like itelligence.  Groupon surprised me in many areas.  My boss was 5 years younger than me, and was not fully experienced to fully manage a large market like Houston.  Shortly after joining the Houston team, the team was dissolved and I lost my position.  The average age at Groupon was 23, and the processes in place showed that dramatically.  I do value my time at Groupon as it showed me what kind of organization that I did not want to be a part of. Love working here, great people and good opportunities. Work hard, play hard atmosphere. The number one issue with Groupon is its inability to keep top talent.  Good people come all the time, but they don't stay long.  It's good for building up some experiences, but it isn't a long-term career type of environment. The outside sales position for Groupon is a very entry level type role.They recruited me with 6 years sales experience speaking about a 250+ book of business. A typical day of work as a customer support representative at Groupon consisted of six and a half hours fielding phone calls from customers, while the rest of our day was spent answering emails or following up on pending issues.I learned a lot about working from the point of view of 'what's best for our customers' as that was always the approach we took. My last manager was great and we saw eye-to-eye on everything. Groupon is a startup, albeit a pretty large one, but still a startup, so there was a lot of room for discussion about ideas for improvement and accessibility to follow through on those ideas.My co-workers were great and were valuable resources whenever problematic issues came to the forefront.The hardest part of the job was the constant change of job function and responsibility. When I was first hired, the job consisted of three hours of phones and 5 hours responding to emails. Over the course of two years, those numbers gradually went in opposite directions and the nature of the job was changing on an almost daily basis.The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was unlike any customer service job I've seen. The culture was very laid back and customer-focused. There wasn't any pressure to upsell or anything like that. We just needed to help take care of as many customers as possible as efficiently as possible. A typical day at work would depend on the month. Management is very inexperienced and is a revolving door. I've had 8 different managers within 2 years. Co-workers are great because they are younger tech-savvy individuals with high intelligence. It's a work environment unlike any other corporation.-The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant tumultuous changes ranging from the the sales incentives & goals, management, and company policy. It would change on a monthly basis.- Enjoyable part of the job: I sincerely enjoyed working there overall though. I am grateful for all the great experience and invaluable business knowledge acquired during my tenure. I can't thank everybody enough for that opportunity; it was a privilege to represent the top company in the industry, for which one this company was the creator and industry leader. I'm confident I will never experience another company with such a uniqueness to it; everything from the culture to the actual role itself, where one has the ability to work with so many different industries and utilize so many different skill-sets. I can say confidently I've acquired more business knowledge at this company than anywhere else...school, previous roles, etc. I say this based off the fact my role there has taught me how to improve my overall self by helping me realize what are my overall strengths and weaknesses are in the workplace, which is invaluable knowledge in order to progress a career and in learning to be an overall better person. Dynamic workplace - more to come as I'm currently only in a temp role - Great training- Awesome opportunities to develop professionally. - Upper management listens and helps solve problems A typical day is fast paced and teaches you to create your list of priorities and manage them in an effective manner and time frame.  The environment is constantly moving towards the future, so you have to be open to change and quick to adapt. My typical day at Groupon started with me jumping right into my job as a receiving clerk, and receiving merchandise as quickly and accurately as possible. I learned to use a Gladiator scan gun, read and understand receiving documents and labels, read and understand UPS shipping labels.. This is a job I really enjoyed showing up to everyday, my co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy merchandise.  Groupon's CS department, like many other departments, was very laid back with a fun atmosphere. Everyone got along and there was a great sense of togetherness because we where all 'in the trenches'. I severed on two different teams in two departments within the CS division. Both of my managers where super awesome, friendly, and approachable. The work is not very demanding, and if you don't mind the occasional irate customer, the job is actually pretty easy.  The positives are superficial (free drinks, relaxed dress code, etc) and overall there is not a lot of room to advance or build a career unless you are interested in dedicating your life to sales. Groupon is a bit of a chaotic place to work. The company still hasnt figured out that its customer is the merchant so it continues to pander to ocnsumers and the company continues to lose merchant trust. There have been massive firings to keep media unaware of what should be massive layoffs. Sales goals increase EVERY month...comission is terrible and it keeps changing too. Pay cuts. Leads are bad...a machine tells you what to call on...you can't close what you know you can close and use rapport and personal relationship so being an outside rep is pointless. The company has not figured out and does not value outside reps and is looking to change that...but hasn't...you are constantly defending your job. They turn you into a inside rep inside your home. Goals are set by the finance dept and if someone gets fired...your goals go up because you now have your stuff plus theirs.  On an average day I am talking to between 50-80 customers and resolving issues. Generally all issues fall within several categories.I have learned to provide efficient service while maintaining a positive attitude.  Mostly I have learned how to use key words to address issues in a quick and pleasant manor. The staff is filled with wonderful people, however it does feel like we are disposable. The most difficult part of the job is to find a challenge or room for creativity. The days become repetitive very quickly. The most enjoyable part of my job is the staff and chance to work with a large and fast growing company.  I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Groupon is a great place to work. It's a young and fun environment with a lot of benefits. I will be at Groupon for 2 years in May and I'm looking for a change. People change jobs almost quarterly. High Stress put on by management to hit high growth expectations.Co-workers are great and much opportunity to be had. As long as leadership is focused on Big picture/long term goals, Groupon Goods will be a force in Online Retail. Groupon Goods is the fastest growing part of the Groupon company. There is a lot to do in such little time yet the opportunities are endless. The hardest part of the job is work/life balance but I knew that going into the position and I feel that I was able to manage that better because of so. They are a company that believes in celebrating their employees. They come up with amazing ideas to say thank you. Groupon is a great starting point when you are not use to being in the working class. It will teach you patience and diversity. Great company to star and unwind. Friendly people, great treatment of contractors, only not so much growth opportunity right away, I enjoy the flexibility in the work place and most of the people are enjoyable to work with Hiring decisions are based on popularity. Not skills or experience. Human capital is expendable... Very young and inexperienced management. - very good training-great company culture with co-workers Constantly surrounded by smart, hard working people. Very fun work environment that allowed you to be very autonomous. The company is large and grew too fast. Lots of HARD work. It becomes your life, but the actual job can be lots of fun. Changes occurring every day that seems to complicate the sales process and creates confusion for the sales reps. Overall it's very chaotic. If you're young and not much job experience, you'll love it. Great place to get inside sales experience and learning how to adapt to constant change. Groupon seems like a fun place to work, and they have tried very hard to maintain the image, but after working there for over 2 years, a lot of the luster wore off.A typical day for employees is about 10 hours and you are expected to be on call all the time. While the public image is directed towardds promoting small businesses and customer service, the work is very sales driven and the focus of the company is not on helping small businesses succeed and there is very little focus on giving customers the service that will create loyalty.The hardest part of the job was going along with decisions from management that were in direct opposition to the stated goals and values of the company.Working with small business owners and finding creative resolutions for customers was the best part of the job. One of the best experiences of my life, what I learned from the start-up to IPO company has been invaluable and something I will always keep with me! Could be better, could be worst. Where it can go keeps you around. Groupon was a fun, energetic company. I called on local businesses and developed online promotions in order to drive business through their doors. This place is falling apart fast. Management is making big bets that aren't paying off.Expect massive layoffs. When I started with Groupon I was extremely excited! What a cool job! This changed drastically after a few months. The Inside Sales person was obviously 'Managements pet' and the the Outside Sales person was NOT! Inside Sales got his choice of all the best accounts while Outside Sales was stuck with businesses that would not run a Groupon because they didn't need too or businesses that Groupon would not run because they would not have good gross profit. Management would simply say that the OS person was wrong and just couldn't sell..Management also had very little if any real sales experience and had no idea how to manage a sales team.Groupon managed in a culture of hostility and intimidation. It didn't have to 'be fair' they could do whatever they wanted. This was across the entire team, not just OS Sales. Everyone hated their job.When I left they seemed to be stunned...'What could we have done to keep you?' I answered with everything I have said here and my DSM acknowledged that I was correct and 'They were working on it' Really? I was a High Preforming Sales person in every other job I had until Groupon. It was not me....it was them. Enjoyed working here when I first started a year ago, since then there has been a lot of changes, stock going down, departments being eliminated and Groupon Now! dissolving. They hire people who are inexperienced to do managing positions. Co workers are awesome, very young environment. Free soda, coffee, tea etc in cafeteria. I love the company attitude. I work in a very low position and every time I point out a system flaw to my manager the information is taken seriously and immediately escalated to the appropriate person. My only real complaint is that my salary is very low and I feel like they are not taking into account any of my prior work experience when considering promotions. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. • Responsibilities included account management, account maintenance, and opportunity development• Built, maintained, and managed relationships with key senior level clients• Maintained knowledge and awareness to understand and identify key industry trends• Prospected and consulted with local merchants to close on compelling offers based on each business’s products & services• Presented Groupon as a unique alternative for businesses to utilize as a way of acquiring new customers within their market area Initially the office was exciting, everyone around drank the kool aid and told you how big the company was. But, if you sat back and looked at the management you wouldn't believe it any longer. It was a 'fun' place but not somewhere to invest your time A typical day at work was pretty great. I learned to work together with an excited group of young professionals, management from time to time was trying but they always had good intentions. The hardest part of the job was long overtime during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers, who were a diverse a fun community of Chicagoans. Groupon is a large company that is still very much a start-up. There is an abundance of opportunity to contribute significantly to the company.A typical day at work consist of checking in with the development teams, setting priorities, removing road blocks for my team, working with cross functional groups to get things done.I have learned how to successfully influence priorities across various groups based on using quantitative metrics and a winning personality!There are bright, yet relatively inexperienced engineers and managers.The most difficult part of my job is keep up with the changing direction of the company; which happens to be a function of the start-up culture.The most enjoyable part of my job is the same as the most difficult. At Groupon I worked with Groupon Getaways. Groupon Getaways is the purely travel dedicated platform that really appeals to the travel savvy subscriber base that Groupon holds. I worked in the Midwest and Canada region. What I would do is call on three star properties and above to feature them on the website for seven to ten days. I learned a lot with Getaways, especially how to be strategic in what you are selling. This includes prospecting and the art of being able to close deals. The valuable experience that I gained from Groupon will be something that I will be able to use throughout my entire professional career. Call new/existing merchants to schedule features of businessesCo-Workers are greatYoung management but everyone is still learningLots of cold callingThe new cafeteria is great, free soda/vitamin water, coffee Woeking for Groupon was a great experience and I would work for the company again. Groupon is the fastest growing company in the galaxy for one reason: we have the best team and execute like nobody else in our industry. I learned to work very closely with multiple team members to execute a great ad on time for the client even though I was home based and my team are in Chicago. I also learned communication is very important on both sides of the parties especially from management when dealing with a very large company. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the success the merchants had when they were very reluctant in the beginning to work with Groupon and myself. The most difficult part of the job was moving to North Carolina and being assigned a territory so underdeveloped that I had no back up power to help me launch this market. Instead I was told to close business in Fayetteville NC where the actual landing page and majority of the businesses closed were from Raleigh. Majority of the subscriber base was from Raleigh. Fayetteville needed a marketing campaign to launch this city and to have their own landing page with their own deals not combined with a very large city over an hr away. The management staff who have never visited Fayetteville didn't see it worth their time to make the necessary changes to develop this market. I started working at Groupon a year ago. I left a really good job to move to Chicago and work for Groupon. It was an interesting experience to say the least. If you prefer a job where you have high income potential with a certain amount of luck and skill, then this is for you. However there is the other side where many people fear that they may get fired that day, and where really good sales people are put in a position that most certainly will not succeed. It is a fun place to work. Young energetic people are all around you. However there isn't much room for advancement unless you want to change markets to a bigger one which could end up being a demotion. It also is hard to figure out what you need to do to make a lot of money because they change the commission structure every month. Expériences professionnelles négative., licenciements abusifs, promesses de CDI à la signature du contrat non respectée. Awesome place to work with great benefits, very flexible positions available. Get ready for a VERY fast paced work place. People are young which is great but it's like being in High School again. Sink or Swim mentality and they work you so hard that by the end of it all, you are emotionally drained. -Great learning experience.-Sharpened Sales Skills-Co-workers are talented and pleasant to work with-Hardest part of the job was the approval process of deals through city planning-Germans implemented unrealistic goals, which go up by 10% per month-Management makes you feel dispensable-Most enjoyable were the people and wearing jeans to the office Groupon allows their outside representatives to set their own schedules. The lack of contact with managers and ever-changing commission and goal structures make it difficult to stay in the loop. Goals jump in high percentages every month and commissions fluctuate, but the base salary is very competitive. An amazing place to begin a career--doing way more than I would in the same position at a more established company. Pains of start-up still prevalent: lack of communication, redundancy, confusion but amazing work-life balance, resources, and co-workers. Everyday is truly different from the day prior. Priorities change quickly but I enjoy working in such a fast paced environment. This is a very rewarding company to work for. In the past year and half I have watched it grow it a real power house in the e-commerce industry! Work hours are long and unorganized. Good potential opportunity, but overall structure is not sustainable. Very competitive work environment and not much team cooperation. I work hard to create strong relationships with clients and ultimately produce revenue. Very faced paced atmosphere with a lot of young people who are creative and bright. Great place to work. Good people and good compensation. An excellent choice for my first full time job out of college. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Busy and very entertaining. I learned how the website works and what groupon is all about.. There is no career growth, and the company lost sight of its mission and values My day-to-day tasks consist mainly of prospecting and closing new clients, while also managing the accounts of existing clients and creating reports to analyze sales patterns to continue to gain profit. Working at Groupon has taught me true discipline when it comes to working in a fast paced and fast growing environment. In addition, I have become extremely familiar with the CRM database, salesforce.com, as it is the main tool I use every day while prospecting new clients and also maintain existing accounts.The most difficult part of this job is continuing to push when I have several people tell me back-to-back that they are not interested in hearing about what I have to offer them. However, when I follow up with a client after they've used our services and I hear how happy they are and they thank me for what I've done to help bring awareness to their local business, I am reminded of what makes this job so great. great learning experience with great people working there I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Simply put...This place is about to be shut down... extremely disorganized, many times a day, orders and entire pallets of product could not be located Communicating with internal employees and suppliers. Promotion is not done from knowledge of the job. Workplace culture is okay. Hardest part of the job is the no compensation, but expected to take a bigger workload. Most enjoyable is working on the computer all day. Very low phone contact. easy job, but if you miss a few days might be hard to meet your target.  great entry level position for someone just getting into the sales field or out of college. Overall it is a great work environment and benefits! They are definitely all for volunteer work and making sure that their employees are involved in their community. Groupon has fantastic sales training, on occasion almost too much.  Sometimes they would have one too many meetings during the day, which would take away from selling, if you were a selling manager.  The culture @ HQ was much better than if you were off campus in working from home, it can get a bit lonely. So, it was an internship, so the pay wasn't great:  $12/hour.  But I got to work on Inclusion and Diversity, and the I&D department is incredible!!!  Really the most advanced I&D work around.  If you're interested in that kind of work, Groupon is fantastic.  They like to portray that it's one of those Seattle-like tech firms with Playstations and free soft drinks, but the culture is really kind of cut-throat and is very high performance.  So if you like that kind of thing, this is the company for you!!!! Groupon was a safe, fun and goal driven enviroment workplace. We have training from our latin america headquarters in Chile and also from our caribbean supervisors in México. The workplace culture was a fun one, they don't have a rigid dress code because the work was goal driven. Groupon's main problem is that they do not value their employees. They said many times that everyone is replaceable. VP's and Executive team are detached from reality and don't really understand the day to day. Beautiful work space and everyone makes you feel welcome.   The training is excellent for phone sales.  I loved coming to work everyday.  Team outings are also fun. The work is easy, but the management is not good at all. Also you can not advance unless someone is no longer in that position. That is very rare. Almost all positions higher up are full and you can’t really go any further than someone working on the floor. Groupon is currently and swiftly being reduced to framework/infrastructure teams in the US, and all new development outsourced to Bangalore. They keep the lights on, and their 'AI' & recommendation system is smoke and mirrors. Don't expect to find a place that is innovating. I've seen the same inventory on the landing page for 6 years, there is no relevance intelligence happening beyond a basic e-commerce level of location.  There are C and D level leftover engineers from Google and Yahoo acting as 'principal' engineers that barely contribute. Management turnover was happening fairly quickly while I was working there and this changed the whole work culture.   Lot's of issues around trust and people stepping on others trying to get ahead.   Very young, inexperienced crowd working there. Great place to internManager has been extremely involved in helping me pursue my own career goals and interest areasExtremely positive atmosphere and appropriate work life balance A typical day at work was fast paced and pretty busy.  I learned to be an effective Supervisor for my team.  The culture of the company was laid back.  The job wasn't hard because all the information needed to resolve issues for the team was available.  I just enjoyed resolving the issues for the customers in a timely manner. If you think you’re gonna come into this job being paid what you’re worth, think again. Just like any other job that want to pay younrhe least and work you the most. A company that has structural problems, they provide a high amount of small perks like free soda, but have a culture where it is implied that things are so fun there's no need for more money or advancement. One of the coolest places I've worked based solely on the work culture. No one really hassles me about my work and as long as it's done on time it's cool. Groupon is an excellent company to work for to get your foot in the door and to start off your career, however, other than cool track jackets for 2 year & 5 year employees, there isn't much of a reason to really stay at the company. Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable, they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets.  This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews, but there isn't incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth.  I came to this company for the experience, with the understanding that this wasn't going to be a long-term company to stick around with, and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.  However, it is not a place to have longer than a five year plan, unless they work on ways to incentivize tenure and compensate based off of skill set and duties. Groupon is an energetic company, and they provide a great number of ways to earn groupon credit, to shop on Groupon. Groupon provides incentives for overtime. Tons of opportunities for people who want to learn, grow, and challenge themselves. Openness to new ideas/solutions. Has the resources and support of a global organization with the feel of a startup.  But the people are just the best, which you will hear from basically anyone you ask. Humble, funny, helpful folks everywhere. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks.

A company that has structural problems, they provide a high amount of small perks like free soda, but have a culture where it is implied that things are so fun there's no need for more money or advancement. One of the coolest places I've worked based solely on the work culture. No one really hassles me about my work and as long as it's done on time it's cool. Groupon is an excellent company to work for to get your foot in the door and to start off your career, however, other than cool track jackets for 2 year & 5 year employees, there isn't much of a reason to really stay at the company. Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable, they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets.  This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews, but there isn't incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth.  I came to this company for the experience, with the understanding that this wasn't going to be a long-term company to stick around with, and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.  However, it is not a place to have longer than a five year plan, unless they work on ways to incentivize tenure and compensate based off of skill set and duties. Groupon is an energetic company, and they provide a great number of ways to earn groupon credit, to shop on Groupon. Groupon provides incentives for overtime. Tons of opportunities for people who want to learn, grow, and challenge themselves. Openness to new ideas/solutions. Has the resources and support of a global organization with the feel of a startup.  But the people are just the best, which you will hear from basically anyone you ask. Humble, funny, helpful folks everywhere. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Simply put...This place is about to be shut down... extremely disorganized, many times a day, orders and entire pallets of product could not be located Communicating with internal employees and suppliers. Promotion is not done from knowledge of the job. Workplace culture is okay. Hardest part of the job is the no compensation, but expected to take a bigger workload. Most enjoyable is working on the computer all day. Very low phone contact. easy job, but if you miss a few days might be hard to meet your target.  great entry level position for someone just getting into the sales field or out of college. Overall it is a great work environment and benefits! They are definitely all for volunteer work and making sure that their employees are involved in their community. Groupon has fantastic sales training, on occasion almost too much.  Sometimes they would have one too many meetings during the day, which would take away from selling, if you were a selling manager.  The culture @ HQ was much better than if you were off campus in working from home, it can get a bit lonely. So, it was an internship, so the pay wasn't great:  $12/hour.  But I got to work on Inclusion and Diversity, and the I&D department is incredible!!!  Really the most advanced I&D work around.  If you're interested in that kind of work, Groupon is fantastic.  They like to portray that it's one of those Seattle-like tech firms with Playstations and free soft drinks, but the culture is really kind of cut-throat and is very high performance.  So if you like that kind of thing, this is the company for you!!!! Groupon was a safe, fun and goal driven enviroment workplace. We have training from our latin america headquarters in Chile and also from our caribbean supervisors in México. The workplace culture was a fun one, they don't have a rigid dress code because the work was goal driven. Groupon's main problem is that they do not value their employees. They said many times that everyone is replaceable. VP's and Executive team are detached from reality and don't really understand the day to day. Beautiful work space and everyone makes you feel welcome.   The training is excellent for phone sales.  I loved coming to work everyday.  Team outings are also fun. The work is easy, but the management is not good at all. Also you can not advance unless someone is no longer in that position. That is very rare. Almost all positions higher up are full and you can’t really go any further than someone working on the floor. Groupon is currently and swiftly being reduced to framework/infrastructure teams in the US, and all new development outsourced to Bangalore. They keep the lights on, and their 'AI' & recommendation system is smoke and mirrors. Don't expect to find a place that is innovating. I've seen the same inventory on the landing page for 6 years, there is no relevance intelligence happening beyond a basic e-commerce level of location.  There are C and D level leftover engineers from Google and Yahoo acting as 'principal' engineers that barely contribute. Management turnover was happening fairly quickly while I was working there and this changed the whole work culture.   Lot's of issues around trust and people stepping on others trying to get ahead.   Very young, inexperienced crowd working there. Great place to internManager has been extremely involved in helping me pursue my own career goals and interest areasExtremely positive atmosphere and appropriate work life balance A typical day at work was fast paced and pretty busy.  I learned to be an effective Supervisor for my team.  The culture of the company was laid back.  The job wasn't hard because all the information needed to resolve issues for the team was available.

One of the coolest places I've worked based solely on the work culture. No one really hassles me about my work and as long as it's done on time it's cool. Groupon is an excellent company to work for to get your foot in the door and to start off your career, however, other than cool track jackets for 2 year & 5 year employees, there isn't much of a reason to really stay at the company. Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable, they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets.  This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews, but there isn't incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth.  I came to this company for the experience, with the understanding that this wasn't going to be a long-term company to stick around with, and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.  However, it is not a place to have longer than a five year plan, unless they work on ways to incentivize tenure and compensate based off of skill set and duties. Groupon is an energetic company, and they provide a great number of ways to earn groupon credit, to shop on Groupon. Groupon provides incentives for overtime. Tons of opportunities for people who want to learn, grow, and challenge themselves. Openness to new ideas/solutions. Has the resources and support of a global organization with the feel of a startup.  But the people are just the best, which you will hear from basically anyone you ask. Humble, funny, helpful folks everywhere. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Simply put...This place is about to be shut down... extremely disorganized, many times a day, orders and entire pallets of product could not be located Communicating with internal employees and suppliers. Promotion is not done from knowledge of the job. Workplace culture is okay. Hardest part of the job is the no compensation, but expected to take a bigger workload. Most enjoyable is working on the computer all day. Very low phone contact. easy job, but if you miss a few days might be hard to meet your target.  great entry level position for someone just getting into the sales field or out of college. Overall it is a great work environment and benefits! They are definitely all for volunteer work and making sure that their employees are involved in their community. Groupon has fantastic sales training, on occasion almost too much.  Sometimes they would have one too many meetings during the day, which would take away from selling, if you were a selling manager.  The culture @ HQ was much better than if you were off campus in working from home, it can get a bit lonely. So, it was an internship, so the pay wasn't great:  $12/hour.  But I got to work on Inclusion and Diversity, and the I&D department is incredible!!!  Really the most advanced I&D work around.  If you're interested in that kind of work, Groupon is fantastic.  They like to portray that it's one of those Seattle-like tech firms with Playstations and free soft drinks, but the culture is really kind of cut-throat and is very high performance.  So if you like that kind of thing, this is the company for you!!!! Groupon was a safe, fun and goal driven enviroment workplace. We have training from our latin america headquarters in Chile and also from our caribbean supervisors in México. The workplace culture was a fun one, they don't have a rigid dress code because the work was goal driven. Groupon's main problem is that they do not value their employees. They said many times that everyone is replaceable. VP's and Executive team are detached from reality and don't really understand the day to day. Beautiful work space and everyone makes you feel welcome.   The training is excellent for phone sales.  I loved coming to work everyday.  Team outings are also fun. The work is easy, but the management is not good at all. Also you can not advance unless someone is no longer in that position. That is very rare. Almost all positions higher up are full and you can’t really go any further than someone working on the floor. Groupon is currently and swiftly being reduced to framework/infrastructure teams in the US, and all new development outsourced to Bangalore. They keep the lights on, and their 'AI' & recommendation system is smoke and mirrors. Don't expect to find a place that is innovating. I've seen the same inventory on the landing page for 6 years, there is no relevance intelligence happening beyond a basic e-commerce level of location.  There are C and D level leftover engineers from Google and Yahoo acting as 'principal' engineers that barely contribute. Management turnover was happening fairly quickly while I was working there and this changed the whole work culture.   Lot's of issues around trust and people stepping on others trying to get ahead.   Very young, inexperienced crowd working there. Great place to internManager has been extremely involved in helping me pursue my own career goals and interest areasExtremely positive atmosphere and appropriate work life balance A typical day at work was fast paced and pretty busy.  I learned to be an effective Supervisor for my team.  The culture of the company was laid back.  The job wasn't hard because all the information needed to resolve issues for the team was available.  I just enjoyed resolving the issues for the customers in a timely manner. If you think you’re gonna come into this job being paid what you’re worth, think again.

Groupon is an excellent company to work for to get your foot in the door and to start off your career, however, other than cool track jackets for 2 year & 5 year employees, there isn't much of a reason to really stay at the company. Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable, they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets.  This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews, but there isn't incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth.  I came to this company for the experience, with the understanding that this wasn't going to be a long-term company to stick around with, and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.  However, it is not a place to have longer than a five year plan, unless they work on ways to incentivize tenure and compensate based off of skill set and duties. Groupon is an energetic company, and they provide a great number of ways to earn groupon credit, to shop on Groupon. Groupon provides incentives for overtime. Tons of opportunities for people who want to learn, grow, and challenge themselves. Openness to new ideas/solutions. Has the resources and support of a global organization with the feel of a startup.  But the people are just the best, which you will hear from basically anyone you ask. Humble, funny, helpful folks everywhere. I worked for Groupon for four years and was fortunate to see upward mobility within the ranks. As the months and years passed I started seeing big issues in the structure and management of the company which is ultimately why I chose to leave. Simply put...This place is about to be shut down... extremely disorganized, many times a day, orders and entire pallets of product could not be located Communicating with internal employees and suppliers. Promotion is not done from knowledge of the job. Workplace culture is okay. Hardest part of the job is the no compensation, but expected to take a bigger workload. Most enjoyable is working on the computer all day. Very low phone contact. easy job, but if you miss a few days might be hard to meet your target.  great entry level position for someone just getting into the sales field or out of college. Overall it is a great work environment and benefits! They are definitely all for volunteer work and making sure that their employees are involved in their community. Groupon has fantastic sales training, on occasion almost too much.  Sometimes they would have one too many meetings during the day, which would take away from selling, if you were a selling manager.  The culture @ HQ was much better than if you were off campus in working from home, it can get a bit lonely. So, it was an internship, so the pay wasn't great:  $12/hour.  But I got to work on Inclusion and Diversity, and the I&D department is incredible!!!  Really the most advanced I&D work around.  If you're interested in that kind of work, Groupon is fantastic.  They like to portray that it's one of those Seattle-like tech firms with Playstations and free soft drinks, but the culture is really kind of cut-throat and is very high performance.  So if you like that kind of thing, this is the company for you!!!! Groupon was a safe, fun and goal driven enviroment workplace. We have training from our latin america headquarters in Chile and also from our caribbean supervisors in México. The workplace culture was a fun one, they don't have a rigid dress code because the work was goal driven. Groupon's main problem is that they do not value their employees. They said many times that everyone is replaceable. VP's and Executive team are detached from reality and don't really understand the day to day. Beautiful work space and everyone makes you feel welcome.   The training is excellent for phone sales.  I loved coming to work everyday.  Team outings are also fun. The work is easy, but the management is not good at all. Also you can not advance unless someone is no longer in that position. That is very rare. Almost all positions higher up are full and you can’t really go any further than someone working on the floor. Groupon is currently and swiftly being reduced to framework/infrastructure teams in the US, and all new development outsourced to Bangalore. They keep the lights on, and their 'AI' & recommendation system is smoke and mirrors. Don't expect to find a place that is innovating. I've seen the same inventory on the landing page for 6 years, there is no relevance intelligence happening beyond a basic e-commerce level of location.  There are C and D level leftover engineers from Google and Yahoo acting as 'principal' engineers that barely contribute. Management turnover was happening fairly quickly while I was working there and this changed the whole work culture.   Lot's of issues around trust and people stepping on others trying to get ahead.   Very young, inexperienced crowd working there. Great place to internManager has been extremely involved in helping me pursue my own career goals and interest areasExtremely positive atmosphere and appropriate work life balance A typical day at work was fast paced and pretty busy.  I learned to be an effective Supervisor for my team.  The culture of the company was laid back.  The job wasn't hard because all the information needed to resolve issues for the team was available.  I just enjoyed resolving the issues for the customers in a timely manner. If you think you’re gonna come into this job being paid what you’re worth, think again. Just like any other job that want to pay younrhe least and work you the most.
