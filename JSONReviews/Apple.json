"content":"Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. The branch on which I was working it’s ok, the professional level varies on the location and your piers. Somewhat unfair, on acknowledging your achievements, There's no human resources. It can be bias pretty quickly. No real structure on how to get promoted. Its totally up to management. They can change team goals pretty quickly without letting you know. Instead of being direct everything is ambiguous. There is a passive aggressive attitude that fills the air quickly thanks to the feedback culture Apple is a great company to start your career in the working world! They are competitive and fast paced, with positions in store that allow to hone in on skills. Ultimately, this wasn't my first place of employment and although it was better than previous employers the pay structure and overall management leaves room for improvement. Apple is a great place to work.  They offer good pay, excellent benefits with great education and training opportunities. The folks that work there are a great group of people and fun to work with. They offer great benefits and competitive pay, but advancement opportunities were hard to come by. They kept hiring from the outside instead of promoting from within. At Apple I received great training, daily feedback to make me a better Tech. It was a very good atmosphere to work in. They made you feel relaxed and appreciated. Good place to work as the work environment is an amazing one. However, job advancement and growth potential is scarce to none. Within the time that I have been here, no progress to develop internal talent has been Working technical support for Apple was one of the most rewarding jobs I've had. Their training has been invaluable for me and my career growth thus far. If not for that training, I would not have the communication skills I have now. A typical day with Apple will consist you working 8 hours (w/ mandatory overtime) hardly any restroom breaks, 2nd/3rd shift hours only, & working weekends, no paid time off, mandatory holidays (and I stress, every holiday) etc. My typical day at work is a breeze. I love helping the customer that call the lines.Management is cool and they work with their advisors. There is really not a hard part about this job. When you are a contract worker, the Apple employees barely acknowledge your existence. Also, I worked at a data center in the middle of nowhere North Carolina for TCS. There were no restaurants nearby and no cafeteria. No company is perfect, but I was quite impressed with Apple's corporate culture.  I worked for the company for 3+ years, and can't think of any unreasonable/overly unpleasant incident to be honest. It could depend on what kind of position you hold, though. If what you are looking for is a good job with a minimum 25 hours to simply help you out while you finish school or look for a more full time job then Apple is a great job. But it has been a tough road to get promotion opportunities and the schedule is set a month ahead so often times work/life balance takes a hit. Management leaves a lot to be desired as at any given time I have 8 mangers to answer to and there is very little communication between management or from management. very friendly positive environment. They are very accommodating and helpful, they made sure that you were always taken care of and if you needed time off for family or anything they always helped. The college program was extremely good. No major related requirements. Flexible hours during school (20 hours per week) and breaks (40 hours per week when not in school). Worked in iOS Tier 1 for iPhone, iPod, iPad I really enjoyed my position with Apple Tech Support. I learned so many things regarding computer OS, trouble-shooting Windows and Mac, smart phone OS, compatibility between different systems, Hardware and Software issues, etc. Good Company. Good People. Only con is they differentiate between Full Time Employees and Contractors. Good food. Overall it's a good place to work in. Apple was a great work experience, work environment, and culture where I worked in my position as an SQA Engineer with a Large cross-functional teams. I like working for apple. I love my team mate and how we come from different background. Apple give its workers the freedom to be ourselves. I love having the ability to make a customer day. :) Good for tech support work because you get great benefits and a lot of flexibility. The managers are helpful and they really try to help you succeed. There are constant perks given and contests to be won. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. This is for Csat Solutions not apple.The company is a joke the insurance they offer only covers preventative care and the supervisors know nothing about the actual job they are supporting or about how to be an effective manager. I worked as a Technical Adviser and that is about the most exciting thing about the job: your title. The pay sucks, the leaders suck, the training is in depth and long. The benefits started soon and were so-so. I (and many others) quit shortly after finishing training because they hours they agreed to work us, were not the hours which were really available. management is so so.. no face to face everything is done over face time or in chat . very fast pace and somewhat stressful. training was very good and organized. its done through a virtual classroom Possibility to learn, grow, get promoted, and make a ton of money is all here. However, it comes at a cost. It will definitely take your life. Don't expect to have too much free time outside of work. Apple has great culture and for the most part will work with employees when needed.  Benefits were amazing and we had a great work life balance.  Great team builders The leads are grace stealing from the processors. They switch up on their SOP and do not train you correctly. Then blame you for all of the mistakes.  ROR was the worst. One minute it's ok to consolidate and ship units one way. Then the next minutes they say you are doing it wrong. They bring in trainers who can't speak English well. So, they half train new employees. Then, when you are evaluated you get negative check marks. It was an okay place to work for. It's remote work from home.  Very fast paced sometimes too fast. Their queue was in the upwards of the thousands. If you work until close, you work until the queue ends...so you will be working past your scheduled shift. Days off were scattered...almost never 2 days off at a time. Shift bids were every 6 months and your first shift choice will almost never go through due to seniority. As part of the college program, Apple works with your school schedule to ensure you are able to work but attend to your school needs. Great management; very understanding and flexible. I am a bad example because the management team was not fond of my outspoken behavior but the job was a drag. They sell you on dreams of getting promoted and make you jump through hoops to do so but they already know who will be promoted. I worked for Kelly Services for the Apple program they have a strict missing no days during Training and because I missed 3 days being trapped in my home due to Hurricane Harvey. When I was rescued I was told that I would not be returning to the company. There is no place like the Apple store.  You meet all kinds of different people who all have an affinity for the Apple products.  There is certainly opportunity if you can get a full time position.  The part time position won't pay your bills but if you get full time you can live on it. I liked my time working at Apple but was frustrated at the lack of opportunity for advancement. I was encouraged to apply for a full time position and after applying, I still hadn't heard any updates for several months. By far one of the best retail jobs around. You get the same benefits as Apple Corporate, and have some opportunity to advance to a corporate position. Fun and I love helping customers . Everyday I had a different task and I worked with customers all over the world . Loved when we had new products and loved when we learn new things. Keeping up with the incredible demand for our products and services is the most challenging part of the role.  The culture and the focus on people is the best part of the job. Apple is really focused on people, whether it is their employees or the thousands of customers we welcome into our doors everyday. It's really nice working in an environment where everyone has your back and encourages your growth. The most Amazing CO. Worked as a contractor in the global benefits area. My manager was the most supportive and the team I worked with was very cooperative and welcoming. Apple is a high profile fortune 500 company. There are alot of high qualified people that work here. This can make career advancement tough. I feel that management for the most part is poor and disconnected from their employees and the department they manage. Apple didn't seem to be interested in training but instead more interested in what you already know (this may be because of the high amount of well qualified people that already work there) .  I have only worked in Applecare. I wouldn't recommend. Employees think they are 'changing the world.' They make and sell overpriced phones. That's all. No one likes hard questions, management doesn't understand long-term goals, just short term stock price. i learned so much from apple that its just amazing now if i need help or something goes wrong with my device i know exactly how to fix the issue i am having Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Like many companies, your manager and department greatly influence your experience of the company. I worked in marcomm and had a great manager and coworkers.My only real negative was that my manager was often away and unable to provide feedback. Amazing benefits however management was not the best to work with. The coworkers were great team players and everyone was very willing to help. Great work place. Apple is a great place to start your career if retail is the path you would like to go on. They offer great advancements pathways if you’re interested in the field of retail/technology. It has a high turn over rate of employees. The culture has changed a bit since becoming so large of a company. Very competitive, but fun place to work. Great benefits, nice campus and perks. If you find your niche, there is opportunity for advancement and stability. Great place to work. Very competitive.  Enjoyed going to work every day, got a little repetitive at times. Open doors for other opportunities and great networking in the bay area. Working there is extremely mentally taxing, On a typical day, I would have to change computers at least once because the first one kept dropping calls or the computer itself froze. We were offered $13/hr for changing to this department, but after 4 paychecks we are still being paid $12/hr despite promises that it will be fixed promptly, so it's safe to say that management leaves a lot to be desired. It's very disorganized and at times downright frustrating, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the people I met there and the laid back atmosphere, or the fact that I am now able to troubleshoot my phone without having to call anyone. Great place. Great people. Flexibility with hours, good insurance, help with school. Nice stepping stone. Companies love that you've worked at Apple!! Apple is a competitive work place if any employee want to get promotions he/she have to know about all the works is done in Apple and improve the information and their educations. then he can apply to the hire positions. Good culture good balance.  Managers and Supervisors made sure everyones voice is heard.  Went out of way to make sure people where comfortable in the work place. Great place to work, enjoyed my time took great care of employees. Cared about our personal interests and lives. Understood circumstances most companies wouldnt Decent company to start out for, they indoctrinate you pretty well. Discount was amazing, and my initial manager was awesome, but he was new to our group as well. Managers who had been a part of the group for a while were jaded, as were the rest of the people in the group. First two promotions happened within a year, and moving beyond that was hard. Had recommendations from every manager I had to go into management, but kept getting passed over just because I didn't have a college degree, despite being the one who trained the new managers on all the technical aspects of the job. This position actually isn't hired on anymore and is done through vendors, and when asked about it i was told by a director 'This is how the industry does it, so we are just being moved more in line with everyone else'. Getting mandatory OT at the last minute is always fun, especially when it's open to close with 6 hours notice. I worked there as a vendor for a year and a half in two different projects. For one project we had the option to commute with the shuttle for the other project the shuttle wasn't available for vendors. I would go back in a heartbeat and push for career advancement. The company is the people. It can be tough just like any job can be, but the positives outweigh the negatives without a second glance. Creativity is highly looked upon. I have worked at Apple so many years ago and things have changed. While I worked  there, the environment was fast peace because of the assembly are that I worked at. I enjoyed working there but it was only as outsourcing for a short term contract. Working at Apple has been one of the best career experiences of my life. The culture is all about taking care of the customer, and providing the best solutions for any senario. Benefits are exceptional and prove that Apple really is a company that cares about their employees. I grew a lot from working at Apple and loved the job. The management was very supportive and wanted to help each person advance. It was also a very fun place to work Ive been working for Apple for about 4 years, I would like to become a trainer or a site manager one day in order to visit Apple Vendors. I love work. I was hired during the peak seasonal period, so i didn't get the complete year round feel. Apple stores have a very strong community and can sometimes feel cliquey. They strongly encourage you to interact with you employees and work hard to advance. I personally prefer a different sort of work environment, and often found the environment to be too big and full of pressure. So I did what I had too and left when my time was up. Tis each his own. Costumer service is Great awesome personnel i will service with them Again Parts and service Insentives Hr Great Great ProductI will love to work for them Again Apple is a wonderful company to work for. They focus on employee personal and work-life balance. I would recommend this company to anyone. They treat their employees well. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Fun workplaceYou learn a lot of new thingsLaid back workplace cultureLaid back management, however they get stern when neededHardest part is putting up with customers It was a pleasure supporting customers outside of the United States.  As a support agent for the Asian Pacific area it was wonderful getting to hear what it was like for technical issues for other customers around the world. There was not alot of activity but there are employees that have not been trained properly and that creates problems for production.I arrived at 6am and worked until 2pm or 6pm. I checked in Drivers with Apple products and inspected their vehicle upon departure.  I answered all call inquiries of delivery dates and times and amounts.  Responsible for providing all shipping documents to drivers. Your experience at Apple really depends only which group you work for. The culture can be drastically different from one group to another. The one I am currently in is okay. Apple is a company that believes in their consumers and employees. They look to empower everyone through their product and services. Management creates a culture where we are all equal and grow from constant feedback. A typical day at work is an 8-10 hour day, shifts based on quarterly bids; taking phone calls from customers world-wide. You will provide technical support for iOS/Mac devices and troubleshoot iCloud accounts. I learned how to isolate issues and gain agreement on the resolution. The culture is very Apple oriented, Apple think, Apple speak. The hardest part of the job is dealing with disagreeable customers and inability to control survey results. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with valued customers who have respect for what you do and your ability to help them resolve their issues. Great benefits, diverse community, culture created is great, and offers competitive pay.Bit too much of a cult for my liking.Too dismissive of anything not Mac.. I was very excited when I started here. It is a well known company and it was cool to work for them at first. The pay was good, got to work in a number of different stations and meet some cool people. Over time though the job lost its luster. The work environment changed, and I saw how hard it was to get any kind of pay increase or career advancement. I don't regret working here but I doubt I would work there again Don’t waste your time if you are working for apple through a third party. The work ethics of the company are the same but the benefits are not. Direct hires receive health care as well as stock and retirement options, PTO and other benefits. The pay also is much better. If you can, keep applying for Apple until you can’t apply any more. Everything about the system and materials to help with the job was great, however the contractor location i was working at (Atento) had a few issues as far as organization, and keeping us informed I enjoyed working at Apple Inc. Very helpful colleagues, friendly management and lots of scope to learn new things and good scope for career advancement The premier place to work in a retail environment. Apple makes it hard to leave due to it's competitive salary and benifits package.Work life balance is still typical of retail and there was no consistency with scheduling, always threats of change. I literally get along with everyone at work and actually enjoy my job. First job that I woke up to and did not complain about going in. Part timers get benefits which is great! and the benefits are the cheapest I have ever seen to be totally honest. There is always room for advancement. A typical day is talking with customers and troubleshooting there needs and getting them ready for a repair. Usually It is so fast paced it is already time for break. Good benefits, but no advancement opportunity Despite what the managers tell you. Job becomes tedious after a while and customers are typically ungrateful. Apple is a nice company to work for. The people there are typically great people to work with. There is an intangible level of politics that get played there, and the merit system upon which employees are judged is cryptic and vague, yet failure to meet the cryptic criteria can have career altering results. It is very hard to get a promotion. Pressure from Management to reach sales goals.  Covered very large territory was on the road every day.  Good compensation and benefit. Youthful place to work I have learned so much working at Apple about the importance of taking care of the customer first! I always worked well with others but the more one on one experience was awesome! Good place to work and learn so much in the field of networking and Network security.The workplace is not as big as the Apple office is but its lot of fun. Typical day would be constant work flow 2 breaks 15 a piece and a lunch And fixing phones or helping customers all dayI enjoyed being able to resolve issues for the customer I worked through Kelly Connection for AppleCare as a tier 1 advisor and then was promoted to tier 2 as a senior advisor quite quickly. Even though I worked from home I never felt alone, like I didn't have the support I needed. I adored the fact that you could take ownership of an issue and call a customer back. Not a call center in the quiet of your own office. Loved working for them. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Work from home for Apple through Conduent IncI work from home We use Webex For our meetings once a week We have standards and are very customer service oriented Solid work environment that provided room to grow and climb p the corporate latter if you were competent and worked for it. Good place to hone customer service and life skills. Great benefits. Fast paced, wirth exposure to technologies as I mentioned, it all depends who is your manager, there is a competitive edge to you end up involved with. The experience alone is worth working at AppleThe pay starts off low, but if you put in the hard work you'll move up  the ladder quickly and get paid better as time goes on.The benefits alone make the pay a whole lot more valuable Be ready to work hard, learn everyday and work with some incredible peopleHad the best management team Fast paced job , but overall I feel it provided good entry level experience in the business world. The job could be a little stressful at times, however the benefits were excellent. Excellent company, Excellent managers, exciting work, however pay is subpar unfortunately (in their retail stores). You can make a decent living but need to spend 10+ years to get a comfortable salary especially if you are single. This is specifically true in the retail sector, and seems true in all retail jobs not just Apple. Even with that said Apple retail employees considerably more than any other retail employee that I know of. Im sure pay is much better in the corporate Apple world. Over all a great starting place for anyone and also a decent place to for a life long career if you see Apple is a great job and a good company. I feel that it is good for younger people however those age 30+ not much so. The progression starts you as an inbound advisor then you move up to a senior advisor. All throughout you obtain additional responsibilities without pay. Loved working there, the atmosphere there is awesome. Very chill and relaxing work enviornment but very fast past as well. Loved the people i worked with including my team. Pay was ok but could be better. Great Company, Great Career!! Tremendous career advancements.I love the ability to work with a company that allows their employees to go beyond the norm. I worked at Apple for well over a year along with many of my hardworking talented cohorts, without being offered full time. Management plays favorites Apple has been the best workplace where I have learned a lot. I sometimes felt overwhelmed but had managed my time and efforts efficiently. The most enjoyable part of my job was I used to travel and test new products. you are your numbers, this was a matrix driven business where coaching and recognition were based on your numbers, and how you score at the moment is what matters, not your track record. Good company. Smart people. Doing release management-business analysis combination. Lot of scope of innovation and making the change you like. In a word a great place to work. There is no work life balance, the expectation is that you will work any schedule with split days off. You are required to work holidays and there is very little room for advancement. I absolutely love Apple, the people, management and the food is fantastic.  Working with the customer were interesting and the ability to satisfy the customer was reward Really great place to work, the only downside is that they do not close for the holidays.  Bonuses every month and classroom training for new software and products Busy, busy, busy.  You stay busy.  I learned a lot about technology and about the importance of corporate culture.  Apple has a process for almost everything.  I still use 'Fearless Feedback' to this day.  It was really like a big 'Apple family'.  Truly value my time spent with the company. Apple used to be an amazing company to work for, but its more about the dollars today than the people. The company took a hit when Ron Johnson left and hired someone else to lead the retail stores. I loved the work and the training and the trainers/managers. However, I had to resign when I did not want to which was disappointing. My mom went into hospice and has very few days left. I asked to take a leave of absence but could not because I was too new. For what the company invested in my training I would think giving me a few weeks off unpaid would be in their best interest especially for an employee of my caliber. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Apple is more into productivity and security and the work culture is very Good. The Collegues are so much helpfull and Team lead and Manager are so much responsible and listens to every suggestion of Ours Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Excellent place to work. Job culture is terrific. There is always peer support. There is an innovative attitude. Most customers love how we do business! When I first started, Steve Jobs was still alive and I felt privileged to be apart of the company.Back then, it felt like we were truly an innovative company. The store that I worked in was my home away from home. The employees were like my family. Unfortunately, as time passed, Steve died and  my store also began to change into a toxic atmosphere. Throughout my time at Apple, there was a sense that to excel at Apple, one must drink the Apple Juice. Meaning that EVERYTHING, that Apple does is just great! But I couldn't help noticing similarities between Apple and the Church of Scientology. Often, I noticed acts of retaliation, people being thrown under bus, as well as people with hidden agendas.But never the less, I'm grateful for the opportunity to grow and become better. I'm especially grateful for the close relationships that I still have with people that I still call my Apple Family. Great place to work, as a temporary employee. Not necessarily my career path so i did not last too long, however it was a great experience and most of the managers are amazing. This job represents a low point in my career and it allowed me to see first hand how corporate America does business. I was grossly under paid by an outsourced company, hired by Apple to maximize profits at the expense of its staff and who fained respectability hiding behind the cloak of contract worker where those very workers were taken advantage of while being expected to maintain standards that flew in the face of common sense and the resources provided to do the job. Working for apple as a AppleCare advisor is a good job and pays well. However it does not offer any flexibility for scheduling. As a phone support advisor you change your schedule every 30 days and it’s on bid type basis. When you bid you never know what you will end up and that makes for a lot of anxiety if you have any sort of family life. The scheduling does not allow for any accommodations for your needs without jumping through a bunch of hoops. A typical work day starts with punching into the company provided Mac and logging into the call logging software. A few years ago this role was solely tech support, the last years and a half Apple has pushed almost ALL customer service responsibility onto its technical support advisors. They still advertise this role as tech support however at least half of the work is not tech support at all.Example: I get quite a few calls about battery refunds, product recalls, and Beats headphones. These are not related to tech support but you will be expected by Apple to handle these calls. Once you are promoted to the senior support level you are also required to take over ALL angry customer calls escalated to you regardless of the issue. Escalations related to account recovery and activation lock are sensitive by nature and a lot times Apple advisors cannot help customers on the phone by design, this will setup the advisor for a negative survey score because the advisor simply cannot resolve the issue. Apple does not take responsibility for this and the advisor will be expected to handle the interaction and receive a positive score. Unless you are a consistent high performer you will work on the weekend. The schedules offered for bids are not typical Mon-Fri work schedules, most schedules do not have consecutive days on/off, more of a scattered arraignment.Example: Sunday, Wed-Fri 10a-9p is my current schedule. I do not work on Sat, Mon, Tues. These schedules change every 90 days, unless you are a very high performer you will get an unpopular shift, another example shift is  Sun-Mon, Thu-Fri 12:30p-11:30p.When I started at this company 4 years ago it was completely different, the technical support work was enjoyable and rewarding. It felt as if there was something work towards within Apple. After reaching the senior support level I am only making $3 more an hour than I was 4 years ago however now I support  ALL customer service related issues that are escalated, AppleID issues, Apple Watch, iMac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad, and various other product lines/services. There is little room for promotion and most promotions are considered lateral moves so you will not receive extra pay for supporting more products or services.Apple does reward you with unvested stock every year as sort of a bonus, once the stocks vest after 3 years you will have access to it. Managerial favoritism plagues a lot of ares within AppleCare, as of this year we have no metric related goals to meet. This means its up to your manager if they want to pursue action for negative customer surveys. Managers will promote, award, and offer extra opportunities to their favorite advisors regardless of over metrics. It's completely up to your team manager to pursue or not pursue corrective action for negative metrics. I feel very fortunate to have been hired into Apple.  I literally knew nothing about being an executive assistant when I was hired, and so pretty well everything I am lucky enough to know today I learned on the job there.  Working in Steve Jobs' office was quite the teething ring!  :) . The best part of all of my roles at Apple was working with such incredibly smart and humorous people.  The worst part was the stress level could be high--no room for error--and the work/life balance was not the best. The only reason I’m leaving is because my wife got a job in a new city. I’d recommend Apple to anyone as a place to work, just like I would recommend their products to anyone! Enjoyed working in a postie environment with great people, would recommend to anyone looking for a long-term position in a stable company with great benefits. Amazing work environment. Great staff, management is encouraging and helpful. Coworkers have a team based ideology. Downside is career development. You work hard as a salesperson just to get full time. Hard to become manager and their isn't much opportunity after that. Wonderful place to work, but not a great place for a career. Even steve jobs got fired from his own company. That tells you everything. cut throat , unreasonable expections and in pursuit of perfection forgets we are all just human beings. I worked at Apple for 3 years and I had the greatest time. I learned a lot about myself and open feedback. Working at Apple definitely shaped my professional career and enriched my life. Apple is an incredible company to work for. Unfortunately, retail is retail. Working in the retail stores attracts a certain demographic, and due to the gung-ho bubbly nature of Apple corporate, the culture of 'the customer is always right' overpowers care for the employees. Some managers will stick up for their employees when customers are being abusive, but more often than not, they're cowards who will do anything to make the customer happy, even if it means letting their employees be abused. And, unfortunately, due to the half sales/half service and IT support you find in an Apple store, the abuse is abundant. Great place to work. The easiest/most challenging job I’ve ever had. Great times great people great benefits! Interview process is intensive so they only pick the best. A well of knowledge. The most easy going place to work. Happy team, happy customers. A typical day is getting the info and goals for the day, learning about issues currently going on in the Apple world... The hardest part was trying to retain all the knowledge you were blessed with. Too big of a company for any effective advancement, or change. Depending on who your manager is you might have opportunities to grow, but corporate is making it harder and harder to advance. Working at Apple for 6 years taught me a great deal about myself and business. The most rewarding thing about working for the company was all the amazing talented people that you worked with and met coming into the stores. Great culture, friendly co-workers. Working nights and weekends tended to be a little difficult sometimes for my particular lifestyle but otherwise a great place to work. I'm so glad to have worked here I learned so much about Apple products and was taught more about dealing with people when they are frustrated. I love to help people fix their problems. -18 months contract, on-site - Very friendly workplace culture - 8 hours work, sometimes required overtime - No opportunity to turn to a full time employee Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Never worked here but would like to. End date 2024.i would love to be part of your team and would make yo proud . Please consider this as an asset for your bompany Your always learning something new everyday at Apple.  There is never a dull moment.  Once your on the floor it a non-stop customer service all around you.  There may be times where it could be High Stress, though there's is always a solution for the best interests of the customer. When I worked there, my duties were clear and I had plenty of help from my more experienced coworkers. If you know where their Coaches do pick ups, commuting's not a problem. Especially with Wi-Fi onboard. And nobody says no to free beer once a month. Apple provided lockers for safety, break space and a friendly environment for employees. The work duties enhanced my General Labor experience. Foremost, my schedule was very convenient. Decent place to work. Third-party company was poorly managed and ran. Small pay for the demands, but Apple as a client was overall very efficient and productive. $15 an hour starting- for customer service specialists in Boston. Great for young people who want experience somewhere reputable. It is very cult-y so be careful not to lose yourself. As an entry-level specialist, you will be expected to perform IT troubleshooting but you are not paid accordingly which is not great.Excellent discounts on products, services, and even phone service plans. As long as you show up and do your job you will be fine. It can be hard to get to corporate depending on your store managers. They are known for making you run in circles to advance. It's just a retail store that sells electronic products and accessories. Managers are horrible. They hound on you to sell accessories and assign salesperson in one area of the store to stand in for HOURS, they forbid any employee to employee interactions from time to time and managers do this all the time. They were not pretty consistent in what they dictate in terms of operating a store and when it's busy. The way I see it, it was not sustainable way of making a living if you want to do this full time. There are irate customers coming in the store to get their phone repaired and sometimes they get over booked causing customers to wait for hours. You end up having to deal with them and become verbally abused but to take it. In retail business, you always have to think the customer is right and kiss their feet. Management at this store was not really good and planned out. They rely on HS part timers to do the sales and operations of the store. It gets quite monotonous and how cliques are in the working environment is pretty strong band because they date each other, go out after work together and all that (most of them went to the same high school). After all I give this store a one star because they lacked accessibility solutions. As a deaf person I was discriminated at this job. I was passed on over by high schoolers for other positions of the store. I was discriminated by not being able to participate team meetings, I need an American Sign Language interpreter which I have dictated through out the course of training and onsite job placement. During work meetings they often  provide video remote interpreters which I can get on the iPad. For large meetings and one on one, they were inconsistent in making sure I get ASL interpreters in person and give me oh I am sorry, we didn't; know that or interpreters requests didn't go through. That's what I hate about this store and how apple manages the store and it's operations to provide equal access and working environment no matter of your disability. Turns out 80% of the employees are LGBT so as a straight person I wasn't used to it even though they just like that. Awesome place to work, Fast pace ,  coworkers are very cool people Apple is one of the best places to work.  The benefits are really good. Lots of training Rarely will you find someone who is going to say anything negative working for Apple they truly care about their employees and it seriously shows in their dedication to us. Managers are always engaged Learning when working from home was virtual The Apple Culture is fun and excitingWorking as a Tier 2 Advisor allowed you be one on one with your customer when having an issueWorking from home was great but was definitely hard when needing to 'get away' from the work area I loved everything about working for Apple The Supervisors and Managers seemed a little too intimidating.  The work was simple and was not hard at all to carry through with.  They are pretty persistent with making no errors. Great place to work. Enjoy going everyday. Finding a balance can be challenging, but the output for the work is a reward in itself. Can't say enough positive things. Worked with small teams and had good working experience. Supportive staff and colleagues. Had a great time together. Executed medium and small projects in 1 year and 4 months time. I work for Apple for almost 2 years. I generally really liked working for Apple. Helping engineers fix bugs was always a nightmare, and beats are terrible It was a fun environment, fast paced and not very fair with the training-process.  If you don't already have some insight on working in that type of environment, they don't really assist you. Every person that i've met that worked for apple has loved the company. Unfortunately working for an apple contract is not the same. the floors are merely boiler rooms where the employees do not matter. fortunately the training is apple and you can learn a lot. Within the Apple ecosystem one will find that it’s challenges, incentives and opportunities will summon skills and assist in personal development unlike any place else. Some of the finest people I have ever worked with. The BEST training I have ever had.Great company with room for growth if you're able to tough it out with the low pay and holiday/night hours in the beginning. (If working retail) It was nice to sit at home to work.  Management was nice and was always willing to work with you. Lots of help when needed. Sometimes being forced to work overtime was not fun but think about the extra money in your check. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Great place with great people to work with. The learning opportunities are endless. Launch was fun to experience as well, if I had the opportunity to do it again I would. WFH through kelly services .. a lot of overtime was available. They provided all the equipment needed for the position. High call volume during peak seasons like iphone release dates. Productive and fun workplace with good feedback initiatives among all employees (including management).  Quite a lot of fun to work there and a very impressive organizational approach that respects individuals. Great job and great benefits but it will have a lot of your time. I love Apple and all of its products. I would highly recommend the company for employment and to shop! Great company if your good with customer service and tech support. Hardest part of the job were the irate customers. management were hands on and very helpful. Customer focusedNecessary tools to do jobKin Care hours!!OUT OF THIS WORLD benefitsDiscountsOpen door policyOTGreat managersRestricted stocks! I had a great experience working on Apple's team. They spent a lot of time explaining the culture of apple in initial training classes but the company dynamic displayed is what made it such a great job and position to fill. Worked with some of the finest and smartest people here. Everyone here has great work ethic. In a short period, sharpen your professional skills by learning from the best. Scheduling was always difficult, weekends were always expected for much of the staff as that was the busiest time of the week.  Management would often back the customer, undermining the employee and the company policies. I miss my job with them so much. It might seem like a lot during training but its really a great job. Great benefits and employee discounts. Scheduling can be arranged to meet your needs. Apple is one of the few prestigious places to work whether it is corporate or retail. Retail stores were a grind in almost every department in Apple. And having customer service skills were critical to your stability in the company. Discriminatory company against minorities and people with handicaps or disabilities worse company ever work for in my 20 year career hope the go broke and fade to non existence like blackberry . Great company to work for. The environment is friendly with a great understanding of work life balance. The campus gives you plenty of options in terms of wellness and career growth. I learned a great deal being with this company. They seriously took me under their wing and treat employees like family. I only left due to moving out of state. the culture around Apple enables its employees to ask questions and really grow and thrive within the company. It does not push employees to just sell products because the products sell themselves, but to find the right product for the customers needs. There is plenty of room for growth within the company as long as you put in the work and effort required. It’s a fun work place to work at downside is once you hit a point it’s hard to further you carreer. When the day starts we are non stop go. We see close to about 700+ people daily and as a tech I see close to 30 people a day. Basically we figure out what the problem is and then we try and resolve the issues within a certain time. customers are mean but the job overall was fun. amazing company to work for and they hire amazing staff. management does put a lot of pressure on selling unfortunately. Would not work with this company with the management team I had to deal with.   If you are not an apple religious zealot then they will not look to you for any further employment.  I never looked to gadgets to run my life but that is the religion at Apple. Fun place to work with great people! Pros include working with a diverse and friendly group of people. The benefits and perks are amazing. The only con would be that it is a retail job at the end of the day so working weekends and nights are part of the job. Apple is a great company and your work feels like it has a big impact, however the work life balance is lacking. Be expected to work 60+ hours and sometimes on weekends. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. The culture of Apple is what makes it special. Your teams are the backbone of everything you do. Be prepared to be surrounded by people in a noisy chaotic environment because it's rarely slow. Technology is a part of our everyday lives, so when things go wrong people get really nasty. Customers will yell, threaten, steal and overall treat you like garbage a lot of the time. The benefits are nice even for part time, but the pay doesn't make up for the stress of the working environment or the people you have to deal with. There is next to no room for advancement. When I came to Apple I had a lot to learn. The most important take away from me was, I learnt to step back and look at the big picture to design simple solutions for very complex problems. While Apple compensates it's employees well, Senior Level Client Services is a brutal business.  To be honest, while I was promoted quickly, I felt I was stuck at the Senior Advisory Level. Everyone supported each other to make sure we were all successful. Everyone was friendly. The staff was understanding and made going to work exciting and fun each and every day. Apple created an amazing culture at the store that I worked in. There was always something new to learn. It was great to work with a team that had each other's backs. We all worked towards a common goal, and were able to consistently be the top team in the market. A lot of drama negatively effects the employees. Management is unprofessional. Work is strenuous. Employees are poorly treated. Unsanitary working conditions. The job itself was very simple, however when switching over  management the job became very 'messy'. There were lots of discrepancies and inconsistencies between managers with the feedback we were getting for our work. Tasks given are easy to do, pressure to meet minimum units per day is there, not enough compensation for what you do. No benefit if you work for the Volt Staffing, sometimes double standard to apply for permanent position compared to those hired already. lenient work place, under good management. They work with employees and other staff members to try and keep the work place a fun, safe, and learning environment. I greatly enjoyed working with the company. Preforming the role of customer service/sales was great because it is a product that people love and is easy to get behind! Taught me everything I know, really have an emphasis on their employees being happy which allows them to make the customers happy. Management varies from location to location, but you will always feel welcome. Allow for stellar personal development that stays with you. your typical call center but, working for a Apple campaign has you fill useful.  Some of the call have you feeling as though you really affect your clienics day. As far as tech jobs go, Apple is one of the highly-coveted places to land. You'll do good work, but just know that the competitive landscape is weak compared to other destinations in Silicon Valley.The core attraction is 'You're working at Apple.' If that's meaningful to you, then you'll do great here.Solid standard benefits. No complaints here.Because you should feel wholly honored working for Apple, you're not persuaded with the frivelous tech perks at other jobs in the Bay Area. No real meal incentives outside of pre-tax money on mediocre food, a minimal employee discount on product you need...but a significant discount on products they're trying to crack the market on. My position with this company was home base iOS advisor. Receiving phone calls from all types of Apple Customer relating to iOS devices. My job was to assist customer with any technical problems or AppleCare issues. Go apply, great company to work for. It’s hard to get in but once you’re in. Completing training you’re in! Great benefits and pay for anyone to live off of. On that time everything was great, and I add with them temporary contract I very successful and happy from them, they are very good peoples and management I liked and I wish to work with them again. Apple was a great company to work for, I regret leaving all the time.  I got to sick to work full time, and had to step back from my position.  It taught me a lot and I enjoyed every moment.  My manger was great and really stuck with us.  I miss my job to this day. Apple is an great place to work for. I had an great time when i work for the company. It was positive some of the time and some of the people that work there were great as well. I worked for Apple corporate for 10 years. Started in 2008 and it was excellent. Employee satisfaction was high and the company treated us well. Then Steve Jobs died and “others” took over. More and more and more “temporary” responsibilities (that always became permanent job duties with no added salary incentives. Sure we had vacation, health insurance (that became worse coverage and more expensive due to Obamacare), 401K, stock options, restricted stock issuances, all the normal stuff. But it wasn’t enough for the work done. Jobs was a demanding tycoon. But after him you were micro managed to death. Good place to work loved the atmosphere strict points system alot of over time good money lots of benefits nice leads lots of opportunities absolutely live it hate the over time and the parking is horrid Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. They didn’t care about work life balance when I tried getting days off for things happening around my life. A typical day would be clocking in, doing my job and going home exhausted. The pay gets you by, but for the amount of work it requires mentally it explains why people tend to gain a lot of weight during their time there. It’s a high stress environment where the ones at the top look at you no more than an item. It’s crazy because you’ll see the managers walk by or even people from corporate walking by all the time not even looking at you as a person but as a robot. There’s a hierarchy at apple and it shows, just work there and see for yourself. I wouldn’t have a problem with this, if they were the company that comprised themselves of being self entitled, then cool. But they bring themselves out to the world as if they aren’t, and being fake is the last thing I want to be. I left on my own, regardless of getting money or not I left because no one cares at Apple. You’re a robot, a cog in the machine to put it blankly and all they want is for you to sell. The management team specifically at this store has had multiple claims about their employees being obnoxiously rude to their customers. Yet they’ve done bare minimum about it. The employees complain about other employees to the managers and they do nothing about it. But when employees are fixing your devices and talking huge amounts behind your back, the managers are all about it. In fact, Hey, they join in too! Then everyone laughs, you get spit in your device and it’s given back to you and you’ll never  know!Did the math by the way. If you were front sales at the store, you could make probably about 5k-7k a check. But you’re not sales because they “Hire you for being yourself and not someone different” It’s a scam haha. Look past it and just get a sales job because at the end of the day I’d rather know I’m selling my soul than being someone who’s selling their soul but is quietly being fed punch whispering in my ear. “Shh you’re not selling your soul here’s 25% off an iPad.”By the way, I made a sexual herassment claim to HR. HR said they would call me back but they never did, she didn’t even sound like she made paper work. Crazy, how a company that bases itself off of being people focused, doesn’t actually give a hoot about it’s own people working there! I made a sexual herassment claim to Apple HR and they passed it by under the wraps! What? I was able to provide for my family, work on my business and keep a smile on my face knowing that the company that employed me will stay in business. Thanks 🍎 It was fun! but Stressful!On a given day you would start the day immediately with 30 people at the door. But working at apple is so cool! Plus you get good discounts on products. Very well run company Work at Apple could learned more different skills, work - life balance. Good management. I enjoyable part of the job is there had chance to worked different type of job. What can I say? It ultimately depends on the store you are hired at in regards to management and overall enjoyment. I work with great people and for a company I admire. Apple has helped my professional and personal development Apple is the only employer that embraces a culture of inclusion. Time management skills are maxed, and must be thrive in a micromanagement environment. Metrics driven, customer service satisfaction driven. The rewards both monetary and personal are great and will carry forward into all other job and life experiences. The hardest part of the job was the time management. Your workday was broken down to increments as small as 5 minutes. Don't be late! Keeping up with your attendance and time keeping as per policy could be challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving all the great customer surveys about how you helped out. Helping people, resolving challenging issues was very engaging. The benefits were above average, the pay was average but the extras and perks compensated for the most part. There was a gym and doctor's office on campus. WE had an amazing cafe with a pastry chef, a brick pizza oven, sushi bar, fresh soups every day, amazing healthy food at cost. There were never any unnecessary meetings, always useful information shared. Emphasis on being polite and nice. Lot's of feedback given in a positive manner. Wonderful people and life long connections. Management needs work desperately, they need to actively take the time and listen to their team.Position status and growth should based on the ability to do the job and not just based on seminal things that have little to do with your core job description. Apple taught me more lessons than I can list and those teachings will stay with me for the rest of my life. Accurately and thoroughly document issues and resolutions through email & phone support Follow documented procedures for problem resolutionUtilize a knowledge base to provide consistent answers Day to day responsibilities included break/fix, sales, management of 10 employees or less during an 8 hr shift. Learn new technologies and you interact with people to help then learn new technologies to assist them with their education. Enjoyed my time there  Learned extensively and appreciate the culture Management was very responsive and easy to connect and speak with.  The facility was great Don't take this job if your not 100% into Apple. If you do might not like the environment is mostly iCare, Applecare, apple.com Kbase you really don't help the customers you look up prior solutions to the issues and there a lot of issues. Best you have Apple ID or Could ID then you'll be screwed! Good place to work, good pay, just wasn't a good fit for me. Very supportive team environment, management was eager to help employees. Would recommend to anyone interested in computers. Loved working at apple. Great discounts and fun customer experiences. Made amazing friends who were super creative and smart. Would work there again if able to! Great colleagues, positive and uplifting environment while helping customers solve problems or fulfill needs!  Amazing management and working relationships. I really enjoyed working at aople. It was fun exciting and an overall brilliant company. I learned so many new things and ways to resolve issues.  I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed working there. Good employees and great training to make sure you know what you’re doing and be prepared to help customers. I would recommend working there. This is honestly the best company I have ever worked for and they truly care about their employees from Personal Growth to Personal Health. I would definitely work for them again. Little consideration to life away from work and the imbalance in place. Immediate supervisors got it but above that it was non-existent. Spent more time reporting what I have done or plan to do than actually executing the plan. I have the ability to flex my time and do what I need to do with my family. I worked from home and I had a chance to choose my hours during the week.. Some of the worst managers I’ve ever worked with. Lazy, incapable of assisting and constantly hiding. It made working there very difficult because when customers are angry, there was no manager to help.Benefits are great. Awesome discounts. But management made it a nightmare to work there. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Working at an Apple Store has definitely been a life changing experience. Yes the fast paced atmosphere of the store is something that not everyone can handle but really Apple Stores are the most well oiled and finely tuned machines in existence. Every little piece working in unison to create one big symphony of synchronicity. Would 100% do it all again if I had the chance. Apple is an incredible company to work for. There's constant benefits, new challenges, and most importantly product discounts. As a college student working as a part-time at home advisor (remote job) for technical support for Apple products, I received two raises within a year and a half. I received full benefits. I would also receive random gifts in the mail! Overall, fantastic job for a young student. I actually Love this Job. Great opportunity for advancement. Great community of people. Your success is based on how hard you work. It’s also a plus being able to work from home Loved my employment at Apple however, once they started to carter to the general public and got to be huge I lost interest in working for the new standard quo company. I wish they had kept their 'Think Different' Campaign edge. I do however love the culture and people who work there. Typical day at work consisted of help desk type support fo 8 out of 10 hours worked. I learned how to work remotely and keep motivation. Management was great for a long time but fell apart quickly once a new manager was assigned. This place has a great atmosphere and culture.  You will be proud to work for one of the most innovative companies in the world.  Its a straight forward M-F 9-5 job and you don't take anything home with you. Working tech support can be hardWorking customer service most often is harderHaving to do both at the same time and add on all the do and don't from Apple can brake your soul. I saw alot of people come and go there some made it a few week some a few month and other years.  Wile the pay is good the stress the job can bring is more the the money it worth. this includes mandtory ot for extended perioeds of times. You can do every thing right but still be docked in a review do to customer feed back that not even about you or the job you did. Example  customer had isshe with somthing else in the company and expressed it in a random servay  they got after calling and taking to you.  Nothing they say was about you or the job you did but you get dinged in the review becouse they gave a low rateing. Then the compuny say you have to do better. no rase for you this time your numbers are off do better or get fired. I loved working at Apple. It was the best job I’ve ever had. I would recommend this job to anyone and everyone. I love helping people. I am obsessed with their products and everything Apple orientated. A former Apple employees back in the late 1990s.Can back a couple of time as a contractor. Each time I found that Apple treats contractors worst each time. They have contractors from different departments working offsite with other contractors make them feel out cast and not important to the work they are doing for Apple nor are they feel valued consultant. I see that Apple culture has not gotten better instead it gotten opposite worst as they grew and it has not seem like they willing to make any changes anytime soon. (I however was treated a 'little' better once they new I was a former Apple employee but not much).  It pains me to see this consider how fast Apple had grew since I left Apple back in early 2000s. Worked at a third party for them. Great place to work, team oriented and the management helped with any problem that may have come up in a customer service stand point. At Apple we feel like a family and we make sure that we all succeed together. Working in such a great environment with other great employees make you feel good about coming into work everyday. Spent over 6 years of my life here.  Over-worked without benefits.  Revolving door of management.  Continually passed over for promotion to full-time, despite working full-time hours.  Cult-like work environment. I really enjoyed my coworkers and bosses. It's a great job with great pay and benefits. I only wish that it was fulltime. I would work for Apple again but only if I can get full time work. The work life balance in Apple is pretty much non-existent. The stress levels are very high since there is never any room for error or any misses. The compensation is great, but it does not account for the stressful working environment and the pressure. I really enjoyed the management  and team support! They are really willing to work with people. I just discovered down the road there were other ventures for me. It is a struggle to balance work and family with the scheduling offered.  The starting wages and increases were great. Benefits were good. Breaks and lunches are required and needed. Same thing everyday, but get to learn the basics of an apple product. Very fast pace, they try their best to think about the workers concerns in any situations. There is a lot to learn at this company. There is a lot of room for growth and they have great benefits. They care about the culture of the company and it is a great place to work. Typical work day as a Apple Receptionist is to come in with a friendly demeanor and always greeting and assisting everyone whether its an employee to a visitor. Contacting the correct person for those whom have interview candidates waiting in the lobby you reside in. Knowing your building like where conference rooms are, restrooms etc. I learned about how seamless it is for each  product to talk to each other. I learned the capabilities of each device and what expectations should be of current devices and future devices. A typical day is about 20-25 appointments helping people with tech support. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. As long as you are good with people, its a great place to work. I had extensive background in product knowledge, but as long as you are fearless in your ambitions the sky is the limit. Apple is such a great company to work for. Although depending on the store location and team it can be very difficult to get days off if you do not request it. Apple provides great benefits and managers really care about your professional development. I am still working here. Super fast paced environment and definitely a job where one must constantly stay in the know and always open to learn and grow. Working at Apple retail is great for anyone who has exemplary customer service skills. However advancing my career at Apple was quite difficult with the over-saturated amount of talent at Apple. As a college student I couldn't have asked for more of a work/life/school balance. There are tremendous, although very competitive, career opportunities if 'you are the right fit'. In order to truly succeed in retail/ corporate you must truly embody the Apple culture - it is difficult to 'fake-it till you make-it'. Apple takes this very seriously. Provided user support on OS X and iOS platform and assisted customers with finding the right product for their needs at home or work.Sales driven role while also having a focus on providing an excellent experience at the Apple Store Apple may be the most revered brand in the world and has the best products in the consumer technology market but there are some holes in the employment experience at the retail level. They is no clear advancement path with people that have career ambition and working with Apple over the years they do not show any loyalty for their veteran employees. It is a lot of work for elevated positions in the store with very little pay. Applecare is a not a fulfilling place to work if your true passion is for technology not customer service. I did well at Applecare I have good soft skills but dealing with the apple customer base made me miserable. Wonderful place to work and learn. Brand recognition made it easy to offer products and services to new and potential customers. Felt comfortable offering ideas and solutions. If you're going to work retail, you should work at Apple. The management at Store level do much more than most establishments do for their employees, and the benefits at all levels are exceptional. Yes, Apple company is amazing but not perfect as a work place for all people. Those who have a permanent job can earn money so much that running a normal life, yet for technicians it is nothing. I never recommend this kind of job to my friends just because of the low salary. Ineffective management.  Little to no direction or training offered to employees. Data center duties include managing vendors and site upkeep. Morale continues to be difficult. Apple is a company where programming is done by developers without Computer Science education. Such employees without proper education think that those who have Computer Science education, do not know how to program. Apple has been a great place to receive experience in customer service and technology. All employees are encouraged to not only drive for results, but also to create genuine connections with the customers that come to the Apple store everyday. We are not just selling cool phones or computers. We’re enriching lives. Apple Inc. is a good company to work for, benefits and pay are unmatched in the retail space. Work/Life balance can be a challenge, but overall, I would still recommend it if you enjoy working with people and technology. Fun company. Environment is great. Wonderful culture. Not much room to advance. Style and method of training is wonderful. Company does know how to take care of their employees. Apple brings upon itself multiple types of individuals, those that stand out in a crowd and those that do not. Apple made it possible for me to learn and continue to grow as an individual. The customers were mostly down to earth and you as a team member are given the tools you need through training before you hit the sales floor.Although you were encouraged to make sales, Apple is non commission based and this made the job less stressful as there were no deadlines to have to abide by, thus making the journey of selling a product that much more enjoyable. Transcom is the worst at home company I have worked for. The pay is not comparable to the other work from home jobs that do the same technical support job - transcom pays less and charges more for health insurance. I made it through the training and my trainer was so uninformed and disorganized getting on the phones was a mess because no one was prepared and had no idea what they were doing. Working at Apple retail is one of the best jobs in the world. You don't work on commission which takes the stress out of trying to sell products. The work environments and employees are the best. I had a good time here, It was a good job through college.  I enjoyed the high paced atmosphere and the social aspects of working in a mall.  I would go back there if time in the day allowed it. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Great job. Work in production work long hours assembling computer chips, testing that they actually worked. Warehouse work standing for 8 plus hours a day. I worked from home for apple THROUGH CONCENTRIX. I was a technical support advisor (Call Center). It was okay, i loved concentrix Apple was alriight , i felt underpaid for everything required of me and they are very strict and tend to wipe all your notes and stickies clear sometimes. Amazing company to work for as long as you like the fast paced environment. I spent 5 years working for Apple and wouldn't have left if there were remote positions for Cyber Security. I enjoyed my time there. The team meetings are always a joy. The culture seems very good. I learned that Apple stands behind its employees and provide them with the tools they need to be successful at the job. Chaque département/équipe chez Apple a son propre sous-environnement, mais ce qui est commun à toutes c'est le goût du travail bien fait, de l'effort supplémentaire pour une qualité supérieure, et la passion avec laquelle tout le monde travaille. I stayed at Apple for the people, the culture, and the products. However, if you have aspirations for anything administrative of want professional development that doesn't involve computers (i.e. HR, culture building, employee engagement, etc) this job isn't for you. They are really interested in developing you if you love computers and technology only. There isn't room for management or admin because realistically, the people in those positions will die there. It's a great gig to have for a short while and you'll make great friends, but it's not a place for internal customer lovers like me who want to add more tone a part of the culture foundation and not just another smiling face in the crowd that is Apple. Position was through a temp agency which has/had a contract with Apple.  Employees are not paid the same as bonified Apple employees.  Work is demanding micromanaged, poor with unrealistic metrics, out of control/rigged technology systems, demands, politics and favortisim/nepotisim. Superior customer service and education on products. Apple is well known for high-end customer service and every one I worked with displayed enthusiasm in their roles, management was great and flexible with schedules, the workplace culture was diverse and interesting to learn about everyone of my colleagues. A typical day of work varied from sales, teaching workshops on Apple products for customers, inventory, and making sure appointments for device repairs, setups, and diagnostics were on time and accounted for. The most enjoyable part of my job at Apple was the people I worked with, the extensive technical knowledge I learned, and meeting customers from all over the world! The hardest part was sudden shift trades or changes, even though I was still able to manage this with my schedule. Great benefits, poor compensation. Apple in a nutshell. You'll hear the propaganda about how great your job is; meanwhile, you'll be paid less than equivalent positions at other companies. If you believe in the mission and love the products, it's okay.If not, good luck. Great Pay  Lots of hours to work  can  get  very hectic with call after call after call . High pressure every one is calling you for a problem very stressful most days. The environment is fast paced. If you are unsure about an issue, there are plenty of advisers that are in reach. Lots of customer service provided and patience is required. Having a good understanding of the product is always helpful. While working from home is nice, Apple struggles to give meaningful ability to advance, with little focus on concrete advancement. Much coaching is focused on loose concepts of customer satisfaction rather than actual knowledge of the product. Apple was a solid company to work for. Just like any other place, there are downsides. But I would assume not as many as some other places might have. Its a great place to work, you get to learn a lot, its diverse, depending on the management, there can be lot of politics involved when it comes to playing favorites I enjoyed my time at Apples call center and appreciated the time management took to help me grow. Although the customers made it difficult, I would recommend this place to a friend. The pros heavily outweighed the cons. Crazy environment but great company with truly wonderful people to work with. No experience like it! Learned so much about the company and products. I loved it! I was surrounded by co-workers who became friends. I was given the opportunity to grow personally and professionally. Apple cares about its people and seeing them succeed, inside and outside of the company. Apple is actually a great company to work for if the technology industry is your field! Very friendly and helpful management style and a very nurturing company to work for! A great place to growWritten by Unix System Administrator (Current Employee) from Cupertino on September 17, 2018This company has provided me with a backbone of knowledge to help me grow. The benefits they afforded me have been paramount in my believe and strength within the company. Good place to work.  Challenging and engaging tax positions and types of work.  G&A functions do not have as many perks as engineering and sales, but no complaints. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. An extremely fun and open company to work and work through the ranks. Being part of a such a global brand can demand a lot of high expectations and stressful encounters. This company has provided me with a backbone of knowledge to help me grow. The benefits they afforded me have been paramount in my believe and strength within the company. Apple does a great job at over-staffing the stores so that interactions with customers are never rushed or pushy, and emerging projects or feedback with team members can be facilitated As someone in their 20's, I did not find Apple's culture to be the most appealing. I wanted to transition into another field but found it hard to take on other projects and grow as an individual since the company is very secretive. The work environment was often loud and disruptive. I really enjoyed my time at Apple, My fellow employees were like Family and the management were open to discuss and assist when times required an open ear. The atmosphere is busy and should require some adjustment for anyone not use to a fast paced environment. EMPATHY is important. If a store is a major financial producer, the culture of putting people first takes a back seat.  Being in one of the largest stores in the country and being with the company for over 10 years, it was clear that as profits increased, the focus on culture decreased. I enjoyed working at Apple for many reasons - mainly, my co-workers. It was great to work with intelligent people, though, the management could be a bit pedantic.  I enjoyed it, but I don't think I drank the koolaid as much as a lot of the staff expected me to. It was just a retail job - albeit a very good one. Apple over the phone technical support was a fast paced teach as you go environment with little room to advance. I learned how to handle stressful situations with ease and comfort. They only care for certain individuals as far as promotions and hours go. Work-life balance is nonexistent, mangement is a complete joke. They will blatantly lie to your face just to get you to stop coming forth about your concerns. I’ve received derogatory comments from a lead and had another lead try to convince me to quit Apple and go to my other job full time. I eventually put in my two weeks under pressure but quickly took it back. They told me they’d already send the request through and that there’s nothing they could do for me. Mind you, I performed very well and had a lot of customers who loved to come to me only. I displayed good work ethic and a great attitude and was basically slapped in the face when they told me they couldn’t do anything. I later found out that you have until the end of your two weeks to change your mind but that was not the case for me. Not to mention, I agreed and signed for $17/hr and later found out I was only getting paid $16.50/hr the entire duration of my employment. It’s really disgusting the things I experienced in my time at Apple but if you’re willing to step on toes to get where you want, this is the job for you. Huge company so its easy to be forgotten but keep your head up and never stop thinking of all the possibilities that you can have at a place like this Apple is an exciting place to work at, though it is also very demanding.   In a manufacturing support position travel is frequent, and involves long hours. Most individuals are open and willing to help if you ask. Great company to work for and can definitely help broaden your horizons. They really take care of their employees and had a great time working for them. Great balance between work and off time Analyze data to work on large projects with a team and use research combined with communication to facilitate protocol and  guidelines compliance in a fun upbeat atmosphere. This is an excellent job if this is your first job. However, if you are coming over from a different corporate job, it is much of the same but with less pay. The stores are usually busy and crowded and most customers are friendly, but some stores are poorly managed. Getting a straight answer is often difficult and you won't receive help if you need it. Managers are extremely over worked and have little patience. They advise you to 'use your resources', which is usually your peers whom may know even less than you.They do offer benefits that some jobs do not offer, like competitive insurance, 401K, company stocks options, and retail discounts. Being retail, you usually have to work the holidays. But most stores offer free lunches on those days. Overall, the company tries to cultivate a community atmosphere and encourages employees to volunteer. They offer company match if you volunteer your time or money to charities.Bottom line, if management was treated better, the employees would be treated better. It's too large of a company for any person to actually matter. And it's hard to understand how a company is worth over a trillion dollars has employees who can barely afford rent with roommates in New York. when working at apple sometimes it can be long. After clocking to start my day I check my work's email for any news, updates ,meetings. Then I began to take a call and assistant customers on what they need. The environment each day was ok everyone seemed nice I didn't really talk to a lot of people. The must enjoyable part was completing a call and the customer is happy. Nothing bad to say about Apple. All thumbs up to the people that are there, along with those to come.There was no point in time while there, that I wasn’t set up for success (multiple forms). Whether it be in the form of a customers experience while in-store , onto simply achieving my own personal goals.Short or Long-Term. You’re surrounded by the tools/resources to make it happen.!It’s a place that has the right idea when it comes to creating Or aiding in the crafting of a strong Work/Life balance.Could definitely see myself returning to the company sometime in the future. Mis-managed from the middle. Oten talent was overlooked by middle-management. Youth was often preferred over experience.  More high profile work was sourced to youth rather than experienced talent. Apple is evolving into more of your traditional retailer. I don't know that it's a bad thing, but the hours are long and customers are not as appreciative as they use to be. Leaders within the company at large aren't recognizing the hardships they are potentially creating at the store levels for both the internal and external customer by some of their policies changes or roll outs. a way to get into ITcut throat management, very competitiveneed better schedulingworking iphone launches was fun thougha way to get into ITa way to get into IT Apple moves slow to convert contractors and at times inaccurately portray that they will convert and several months go by and no change other than more work load and no change to the status of contract conversion.  Feels like they use you and then release you. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Apple is a great place to work that really focuses on you growing as a person rather than forcing you into a sales role. The focus on the customer and the complete solution builds a really great work environment. Amazing people and benefits that most would not even think of having in a workplace environment. I would recommend this job to anyone that is high spirited and energetic. Calming calls not to bad of customers funny people to interact with and fun events occor. Fun Halloween and Christmas activitys and amazing computers. Work with the best become the best. Your career is what you make of it. Perfect place to work for go getters. Do not expect management to take interest in your career. It is up to you to have experiences, promotions, raises and advancement. The people you work with are wonderful but it is retail. So hours are all over the place. They could pay more, if you are full time you need another source of income. You can't live on it and advancing is almost impossible. Too many people who want to advance and not enough positions. I enjoyed it for the most part, but the people were very fake and always felt like there was a target on your back. In terms of compensation and the room for growth, Apple was phenomenal there. I just did not enjoy the culture, tough to fit in. The slavery might have left America, but it is prevalent in Apple. If you are contractor, you will be treated as low class. Confidentiality is important, but not at the cost of not trusting anyone. Work might be exciting, but all your hands will be tied to perform your job. Too much micro management when it comes to contractors. Your self dignity is harmed and hammered to floor everyday. It was a punishment of me. Tier 1 work hours can be grueling when working At-Home, but rewarding when you know you have helped someone.  I had the pleasure to help many who's only source of communication with deployed loved ones were their Apple devices. Excellent customer serviceFlexible work schedule40 hours a weekAnswering calls Paid trainingLearning excellent methods of probin and communication It is better to have a name on your resume then actually working for it. This company has control freaks, highly under valued people. Management have to improve a lot. These campaigns were both cutting edge that required us to develop proprietary methods, platforms and software to achieve the goals. Extremely difficult dealing with foreign governments to acquire the locations and the permission to fly over the various environments we did.  Almost died a few times in the helicopter, but thats expected when you log 300 plus hours globally.The gig of a lifetime.  Very proud of how both of these campaigns came out. Very balanced workday and looked forward to showing up to work everyday. There was always teamwork from the time you walk in the door. If you do not know something ask, and if you want to grow find and seek others on how to get there. I had a lot of fun at Apple. Moved across the country, met a lot of amazing people, and learned about the culture from Apple.A lot of people say the employees are brainwashed but they're not. It's a big family and you just feel as though you fit in. You're encouraged to do your best and praised if completed. Apple used to be a great company to work for, but the culture has changed a lot.  The one REALLY, REALLY good thing about Apple is the benefits.  I don't think there are very many companies that can match the benefits.  The pay is relatively good, but unless you know how to work the system, there is no opportunity for advancement.  I would only consider working for Apple again if it was in a Retail Store or at a campus in a development or team capacity, and not in technical support.  Technical support relies to heavily on metrics, and metrics rely too heavily on 1/10th of your actual work.  It simply doesn't account for the 'real' work that you put in. Apple's the best for a reason. Loved working here. The people that work for this company are chosen carefully, and make it just a fantastic place to work. Think long and hard about it. Theres a reason you never see the same employee twice. Over priced products, not worth the price. Mediocre work life balance, and worst part is that you barely make enough to survive. I especially on a single income. Forget trying to go to school, church and working here you'll be too tired and stressed to find the time. Honestly not sure why no-one has blown the whistle? Oh yeah we all signed non-disclosure. it was fun to test the products.  Great gob for you-tubers who want to test and review products.  it healed me a lot got me more views and likes.  they where very nice to Great place to gain experience and learn more about the company afrom the inside. Has a lot to offer as an employer. Great employee discounts and benefits. working for apple from home is great if you dont desire consistent advancement. pay is great, hours semi-flexible. If customer service is not a long term career goal, this is not the gig for you however. Apple was a great company to work for. I learned so much about myself, managing others , managing up and down levels and about technology. Culture of company is amazing and made you want to go to work everyday. You had the opportunity to manage all different types of people and 5 different areas of the business. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. It was great to be indirectly involved with the creation and alterations made to IOS systems and updates that so many of my friends and family were using Apple is a good place to work for a single person not someone with a family . Especially when you have to commute 50 Mies back and fort every day, It is recommended for people who live in Elk Grove and Florin area. easy going/fun environment, great for people starting careerif you are willing to relocate theres a potential for career developmentgreat benefits and discounts Nice company to work for. Compensation is better than most places. Overall people are friendly. Attendance and friendliness is important. Would recommend working there as long as you remember one thing... You're always replaceable at a company most people would enjoy working for. Overall, a very nice place to work.  Great compensation for a retail position.  Most apple stores are understaffed and / or under trained to handle the high traffic levels and needs of the customer.  The model for repairs needs to change.  My estimation is that 50 percent of in store managers are not customer focused enough to properly help the employees.  It can be a very stressful job due to the high traffic. awesome place to work with amazing management and great coworkers. little to no stress with great pay to keep workers able to handle bills and enjoy their day to day lives too What did Apple is actually pretty good. The benefits are fantastic. The discounts are also pretty great. My major problem working at the Apple store is the management. It is a very clicky, political environment. In order for you to advance you have to broadcast yourself to everyone. If you're an introvert it's going to be very difficult for you. Great company bogged down by lazy heartless mangers whom would not be missed if the company decides to do a cleanup.  “We don’t quit our jobs, we quit our managers.” I know of 4 others that are in the same position and are looking elsewhere. HR has been no help since they need evidence before approaching the manager. Career growth in Retail is limited after entry level management. Internal promotions have decreased drastically over the past three years. Experience is variable based on your regional (market leader) manager. Overall Apple Retail offers a great first or last career but not recommended for anyone that is not in college or looking for a job after retirement. Pay is strong for the job scope but benefits (stock) has reduced drastically over the years. I've had a good experience, but cultural changes have impacted the employee experience negatively over the past three years. Good overall good experience. Got to learn and work on many challenging tasks. Builds a good career level and carries a life time technical skill capability. The most difficult things about working at Apple are common issues with retail in general: often understaffed, variable schedules, and very busy holiday seasons. Excellent benefits, discounts, and promotions for employees and a great culture help make it worthwhile. The managerial styles, however, can be quite variable from one store to the next, creating either significant opportunities or roadblocks to personal development within the company. Being able to work from the comfort of your own home. You will be able to schedule what days you are available to work. Some times you will get rude customers, but it is up to you to maintain a calm attitude and continue to help the customers. To work with management its really hard task, the work pressure will be more and more. We have to take care about our timings many of the people work offshore, to manage offshore calls its  high task in different timings. They are not going pay anything extra for call times. Fun, they take care of their employees, very busy but multiple breaks to refresh yourself, great benefits even for part time employees, pay is good compared to any other retailers. Apple used to pride itself as the best company to work for because they were 'different'. However in the last 4-5 years it has become very typically corporate. When I began it was different as it had all the best aspects of a small company feel with the job security of a large corporation.I will say that the benefits are very good. Time off is about average for lower management and lower. Pay is the low side of normal, which in my opinion, is unfortunate. Apple prides themselves on the best customer support for their devices and services, however, they do not compensate their low end employees as such. Apple is a great company to work for. Each technician has their own work station, to fulfill their job duties, free from distractions. The opportunity for cross training is always available, and encouraged.  I like that overtime is not mandatory, but is also, always encouraged. I noticed that the management for apple are very patient, and understanding, of the different growth speed of employees. I began my contract with apple as material handler, but through my willingness to learn, I cross trained to repair technician and calibration technician. One of the difficulties of the job was the fact that the warehouse was not an environmentally controlled warehouse. Apple has a fast-paced working environment and result-driven working culture. It is a good place to advance one's skill............................... If you have the ability to work in a fast, timely manner with a loud environment, this is the place to be. It is always a crowded environment from the moment the store opens until it closes. Filled with lots of energy, you have a great time and numerous resources to turn to when unsure about how to accomplish something the right way. Management at times cane be more on the micro-management style but overall, managers are fun and easy to talk to. Not going to review out of respect for the company culture. This place is amazing and can be awful. Every department is different and all people value secrecy. My day was never really pleasant. It almost seemed like the company did not care for there employees. I was able to tolerate it there because despite how pressured it is to work there, I was paid a good amount of money. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. If you are a tech savvy person and you like Apple products this is the place for you! The culture is one of a kind and the people are great. Learning is a must! Become the best you can be! I have learned so much here at Apple. The companies culture is amazing and the people here are incredibly smart.  What I enjoy most is being able to have all the resources I need at my disposal. I was only working for a short time at Apple. This does not give me enough insight for a detailed review. Employees seemed to be passionate, a common vision is shared. It's great for entry-level call center work. However, contracted individuals are managed by outsourcing firms who micromanage and treat associates like numbers. I would not take a pay cut by $5 to work for the middleman. Fund job. Annoying customers. Most basic technical skills required. Training offers all the knowledge you need, no real IT experience needed. Would recommend this job to get into IT field. Pros-Great culture-Innovative products-Positive work environment and team-Respected work/life balanceCon-Slow advancement -It's retail-It's retail again lol Apple hires people for their character first and then invest in developing the skills and knowledge of each employee. That being said I worked with amazing peoplem made life long friendships and learned a ton. Becasue Apple invest in it's people, everyone leaves better than they came in.It also doesn't hurt that Apple is the most valuable and admired company in the world. You get the best of both worlds. Great peers and a great brand. While the company provides you with great benefits, the work is extremely demanding. This isn't necessarily the fault of the company, however they could have taken steps to alleviate the stress of the job. Treated as if you are a machine instead of a person. Your life revolves around Apple and not the other way around. Vacation is not given at one time, which makes it hard to plan anything. The hardest part of the job is lack of entry level and advancement opportunities. Awesome company great to be there, would recommend it to any body because hiring process isn’t difficult and once you’re hired there’s all types of great benefits fosters creativity and individuals. not much flexibility when it comes to scheduling outside of school schedules. experience very dependent on manager Fast paced and extremely customer oriented. Can be stressful at times and rewarding at others. Must adapt to constant change between procedures and work environment. The team work is great. The perks are great. You have a mentor and team lead you can go to for anything. Customer service is big at Apple. You have to have a strong mindset to work there and not take things personal. The only con about working in apple retail is the retail hours.. the company is A1, and you are one lucky person to say you work for Apple..great benefits, great people, great company Apple is a great company with amazing luxury items.The culture looks relaxed on the surface but is quite competitive.Due to the sheer abundance of qualified staff there is always a bottleneck to overcome when you are attempting to grow and advance.For that reason, I think APPLE is a great part-time job. A typical day at apple, is fast paced, fun loving and team oriented atmosphere, surrounded by hardworking people eager to help customers with any problems with their apple product. The only positive was the benefits. I received full benefits as a part-time employee. Work culture felt so fake.  To much sugar coating that made you feel like a little kid.  I would not work there again. Apple is an outstanding and forwarding-thinking whose innovation has paved the way for awesome products to be introduced the public.  Apple is a proven global leader when it comes to providing an interesting way of communicating.  They are pacesetters. Apple is an interesting culture. People are extremely passionate about their work. It is great to work for a company where you see your contributions being made available to the rest of the world. I worked there during the days of Steve Jobs, so leadership was an A+ If you are a contractor then you are working purely for your pay. There is almost no opportunity of being a full time employee. Out of probably 100 only 3 went full time. You will be told good metrics will look good on your application but honestly it doesn't matter. I've had top metrics on my team for 9 monthes in a row and was not even considered for the position, and my metrics are better than most full-time employees. I know somebody with horrible metrics went full time though. The recruiter for apple is completely separate from your managers and others you work with. This means managers/supervisors know they are saying pure double speak when they say there is good opportunity for going-full time with good metrics when quite literally your metrics has nothing to do with your chances of going full-time unless you get fired during the contract.Other than that everything is easy-going. Most people excessively slack off to the point where I actually do nothing half the time and I still have top metrics and have better metrics than most full-time employees. I actually have a co-worker who watched the world cup during work and only received a warning after a month. You will only get fired if you have horrendous metrics (probably requires 1/5 as worse as my metrics) or do something stupid like get drunk on the job. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Best Job I have ever had to be honest. wish the pay was a little more, but loved my time there. The leadership all the way from top down is something that impressed me incredibly. El ambiente laboral era uno muy bueno pero a la vez muy difícil, siempre estábamos en un constante ajoro y estábamos muy ocupados. Apple is where you want to be!! You don't have to have the hard skills of being technically savvy. Just like helping people and you'll do fine. Keep your head up too I was given hope that I would be kept on as full time after holiday season and was abruptly told differently. It seemed that there were not enough positions available although every other seasonal employee got to stay on. Lots of benefits and fun to work at made a lot of friends in the company. Very face paced lots of discounts always helped when you had a question about something I loved working there, I learned a lot in my first contract role. Communication within the team could have been slightly better. I was not directly employed through Apple; I was a contract worker through Pro Unlimited, Inc. My pay was competitive, but benefits were the bare minimum. Since I was a contract worker, i was never allowed feedback from my supervisor. i always got the feeling that Apple did not want you to succeed. My team worked well enough together, but everyone really was looking out for their own interests. The only way to get more experience there was to sweet talk the supervisor into giving you more projects. Consistency and dedication are not rewarded as a contractor. My experience at Apple was not the best. I'm not sure where to begin...I started in tech support in 2010 and worked as a whipping post for about 2.5yrs before I was 'promoted' to a sales division for small and medium business. The pay was dismal for the amount of work that was required. You were set on an inbound queue with about 10 seconds between calls. When the call was answered it was a generic customer but you were instructed by your manager to convert them into a 'business customer by all means'. It was unethical and turned customers off from doing business with Apple - all the prying questions we were mad to ask. The AUX culture of Apple is ridiculous! By 'AUX culture' I'm referring to the phone monitoring system that have you attached to all day. There are varying modes to be in but they want you in available at minimum 6.5hrs hours a day. So basically all you really get is your lunch break and two 15 min breaks - standard - except for the 'variance penalty' of 5 minutes. You can stray from your 6.5hrs a day by 5 minutes and not get reprimanded or written up. So if you've used up all your time for the day and you have a sudden bowl movement that is critical. Expect to be talked to about it. I would not recommend working here for the lack of advancement within the company. You get locked into a role and then they 'up-train' you to support other divisions with no raise in pay. Before you know it you're trained in 5 different divisions, which now the queue is expanded to take those calls, and you get no 'reward' for taking on extra roles in the company.  Not my cup of tea. Working for Apple in college was a growing experience helping me gain strong customer service skills as well as technical knowledge. I cannot recommend this experience enough. Cream of the crop of retail. Apple is a great place to have a career.  You work with great people towards a common goal - delivering unparalleled customer experiences.  The Culture is amazing. I learned a lot, the team was fun and super smart. Projects were cool. Perks and salary are great! The brand name stays with you. But I didn't really enjoy the secrecy aspect much. Everyone knows what Apple’s culture is like, same goes for actually working there.  A lot of politics, be prepared to jump through hoops and never forget this is a RETAIL POSITION. Benefits, discounts, perks are ahh-making. Take advantage of them even simple ones like discounted movie tickets)!! Fun and Fast Paced but lacks Career Development. I have lifelong friends from working there and for that reason alone it was difficult  To move elsewhere. Apple is the best company I worked for in my entire experience, really like a one big family and we all enjoy and encourage each other by proving positive and negative feedback A company that goes above and beyond for the employees, with amazing benefits and a very competitive wage that is fair for you. a good work environment with amazing communication with management. I not only enjoyed my time with apple, I grew professionally and personally through the environment, resources, training and opportunities that apple provides to their employees. I'd work there again. Working at Apple was a dream come true and I wish I would have been able to stay. Very fun atmosphere and everyone feeds on being the best. The best culture Ive seen in any working experience. not a good place to work bad management no advancement pay is low for the work short lunch breaks the the parking is to far from buliding no overtime paid Apple was easily simultaneously the most fun, and most challenging Career prospect I've had the privilege of accepting. The culture within the company is wholly unique in it of itself compared with any employer I've experienced as a working adult. Very easy to get alone with people and customers. Also felt like a safe enviroment. Over time was always great. They made us feel comfortable and it was really fun. Apple is a trillion dollar company, and a good one to work for. It is an easy job if you are an extroverted individual that uses Apple products. It is also a great place to work if you are currently in school or have another occupation. The benefits and pay surpass general retail stores (especially if you are a full time employee). However, there is a lack of development when transitioning to different roles as well as the corporate world. I definitely recommend that this company be used as a stepping stone towards bigger and better things. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Overall it was a great job with amazing perks. I could work from home, pay and benefits were great, & coworkers and the company were fantastic. It is very fast-paced and stressful though, and work/life balance doesn't always work out, even if you are working from home. Customers could also be very demanding, and not very amenable. I would consider going back, all in all. I worked doing phone support through them and it was enjoyable all the way around. I moved up through the company with great ease due to my knowledge and experience I had before coming to work for them. low income but amazing work environment, co workers and management are great, amazing tram support and culture, discounts could have been much better. customer service for apple products and all customers were made because they were understaffed and there was a huge turn over rate. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Schedule walked blocked for the day and pre planned including breaks and lunches that never occurred on time due to customer demand. Treated employees like children when it came to behavioral corrections with a point system. Apple is a great company to work for. All of my managers were supportive and wanted to see me succeed in every possible way. Benefits were amazing, Pay was fair and job was strenuous but rewarding. Working at Apple is fulfilling in a way because you feel that you are really a part of something special. However, the feeling certainly disappears once you have to deal with management. The problem is that there is not enough managers, and there is no consistent managing style, so there is never really any sense of growth because everything is in a constant state of flux. I would love to continue working for Apple, but the thought of wading through that pool of management disarray any longer is definitely what prevents me from staying. Great place to work but a dead end for a career!  Coworkers and managers really care about you.  Customers can sometimes be amazing and sometimes be inconsiderate and de-humanizing.  Amazing benefits. Apple is one of the most important and influential companies in the world. Working for them was an honor.  The internal culture is like no other. You will pride yourself working for them. Depending on the position you work for you will have more control over the schedule. It is harder to balance work and home in starting positions. My typical day was amazing at Apple in Best Buy. I was with a fun group of people, and my manager was great at making sure we were up to speed with everything. The most difficult part of the job was having to leave the fun environment after the time had been completed for the temporary position. I'm consulting at Apple and it's very clear of the separation between consultants/contractors and the employees.  Employees stick together and exclude the consultants/contractors from most activities.  You get use to it but for me, it's not the ideal workplace culture. you learn so much working here, even from the interview process (personally it took 4 interviews for me to get it but that may have changed over the past couple of years). they definitely could pay more considering how much the company makes/is worth as well as how much the products are Everyone is rude from staff to customers. Human Resources are never around to talk to about needs for their employees. Supervisors are two-faced and had favorite advisors. fast paced work environment  that struggles to meet the the personal needs of its employees. the needs of the retail environment usually are met at the expense off their employees It’s a great company to work for. They teach you a lot about life inside of Apple but also want you to grow outside of Apple. If you’re willing to work hard and take the time to learn you can go far. Had a decent time working from home. Always changing products and policy means roles can change at any moment. Didn't love constantly changing management. The teams at Apple are inconsistent in how they are managed. Some have good work/life balance, some have work from home privileges, some have inconsistencies within the team where privileges are granted to some but not others depending on the managers whim. I'm not allowed to go into detail about my views on the company, but I can tell you in short that it's an excellent place of work. The quality and craftsmanship of their products match just how much Apple cares for its employees and each individual's personal and professional advancement. Tons of discounts through other retailers with this job which is great. Cult like culture and environment definitely made me uncomfortable. They have WAY TOO MANY managers, & when you have a bad one there are SO MANY WAYS they can get you to quit or get fired. Another reason why I left. Apple was a great company to work for. I met many influencial people. It was a hard decision to leave after 6 years with an amazing team. I had the opportunity to work in office and transitioned to mainly telelwork. A downfall is that I learned this company is about who you know to advance further in your career. The hardest part of the job was working from home and applying for other positions when management doesn't see you on a day to day basis. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. I loved the people, the atmosphere, mangers and advancement opportunities. It was also a great place to learn. I use the skills and training I received from Apple now, years later.  I could have stayed and advanced to full time and even into management but I did not. I think I would have liked it better if I did. I got burnt out on the hours, stress of the busy Saturdays and not making that much money. It’s a great work environment. Once you’re in it’s hard to imagine working somewhere else because of the culture, pay, benefits, and management. But promotions from within are hard to come by. Probably one of the best companies to work for, hands down. I enjoy going to work everyday. The Apple culture had made me a better employee overall. A+ I worked at an Apple data center and learned a lot from this job environment that I can take with me anywhere. Although the job site was smaller then others and the growth was very limited low turnover rate from contractor to FTE. I'm grateful to be apart of this company and being able to work on advance servers and equipment. I soaked everything up like a sponge and hopefully I can find a full time job at another reputable company with room for growth within. Apple is a great place to work.  It is a positive environment that encourages their employees to do the best they can in a supportive environment.  Although I felt that I did feel that my position was not ideal for me, I did enjoy my time there and have nothing negative to say about my employment there. I was a member of the Business team at Apple Retail, so the position was largely communicating with in-store customers about business needs. The role was interesting; I did well. Really great place to work. I highly recommend it for everyone. I take customer service and technical support more seriously than most. But through the tools of apple I was able to create myself into a better version of me. Apple is a great place to work because of the people you encounter not only as customers but your colleagues as well. I've made great friends and have learned so much about the company and myself. Working for Apple helped improve my communication skills in my daily life. Apple is a great company to work for. They are progressive and dynamic. This is a great place for people looking for a culture that cultivates greatness. Get benefits, even for part-time employees, and great company culture! Make sure you take advantage of all the perks and take care of yourself it will make work easier. Great company! NICE PEOPLE! Hard to network at home. Have to preform every day!Scheduled are random unless you preform well!Culture is chill, laid back! Fun place to work with a lot of good opportunities to advance.  The pay is competitive and the benefits are particularly good, especially for working in a retail environment. The days are long because you are either dealing with angry (majority) or non tech-savvy customers. Management is not helpful towards your professional development. If you are over 25 years old, seek other employment as Apple does not compensate well AT ALL. Apple is a great company to work for. Day to day was easy and they are supportive. But if you don't live and breath apple, you could have a hard time. The only good thing about Apple's new hire experience is that they provide all the training, although the training is crammed into 4 weeks I think. I felt It was more like a high tech sweat shop.  You work long hours for minimal pay. You have to deal with irate customers and are required to get them off the phone within 12 to 15 minutes when it could take twice as long.  I just didn't feel it was worth the hassle and the lack of care from the administration.  I won't work for apple again! I found that working as a remote adviser was not for me.  I prefer to work in a team.  Apple did have multiple opportunities to video chat with a supervisor.  It was my fellow team member that we never interacted with except during online team meetings. Apple provided alot of culture and job information.  I actually miss working for them, yet at the same time, I've ironically missed alot of time with my family being that this is was an at home job. Apple is a great place to work. I really had a good time as a Technical Specialist. Managers are very good in general and always are willing to help you. It could be little hecktic and some customers are computer literate.  This can create issues if they are unable to follow basic instructions. The training was easy and they had mentors that helped us along the way. There was always help when we needed it and it was easy to communicate with superiors.  The customers may blame you for problems beyond your controle. Everyone was very helpful during my training and work time at Apple. I was an At-Home Advisor, they supplied everything I needed to complete my work efficiently. Co-workers, supervisors, and even other departments were very supportive when I needed assistance handling customer issues. Training was also informative as well, my trainer ensured that I had all the resources necessary to understand everything I needed to know about the job itself. If I had the opportunity, I'd love to come back to work for the company, I had family issues going on at the time where my ex mother-in-law was gravely ill. That interfered with my work, however they were very understanding of my situation. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Great part time job. Great benefits and they work with your schedule.Stores are packed but the time goes by quickly. Stay focused on your goals and the customer experience and you will be just fine. •	Provided phone and email support for customers with Apple iPhone and iTunes software. •	Assisted customers with iPhone operation, software installation, configuration, and usage on all issues relating to their account. •	Maintained customer satisfaction with outstanding rating and participated in continuous improvement and training programs. The toughest thing about a job at Apple is the politics and being savvy enough to navigate through situations politically. Other than that it was a good job with great benefits. Was very unprofessional Lots of drama between managers and advisors Disrespect towards each other as well as the customers Did I mention drama .... Very lay back environment. I love coworkers, and we had great customer.  A typical workday sitting at your computer taking calls  login information into the computer, Not perfect, but everyone is continuously focused on ensuring that vision is being protected.  Teams are well trained and investment in training is top priority. ongoing At Apple, you will spend a lot of time working 50+ hours but you know you are working a good product for people who want to it. Quality is important as well as features which are nice but do not expect free food or lots of parties.You will spend most days in 3 meetings to discuss your project while fitting in testing time around the meeting.Management is varied depending on your team. Some are old school Apple while newer teams have a more silicon valley approach. Feeling like you get everything done during a product cycle. No one wants to be the one who missed an issue that ruins a customer experience. I worked here as a contracted employee through an agency. Though I was treated fairly well I did just feel like just a number...a basic cog in the machine per se. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of people I met while I worked in the warehouse. I have mixed feeling about my experience working here so I believe it is safe to say that it was okay working here. It was okay sometimes work slow sometime stacked up lots of overtime literally everyday . The one thing i dont like is they have rules everyday and you cant wear metal So training was no so good really didn't feel like I learned a lot trainer was super young once we got on the flor super nervous felt like I didn't know anything but our floor walkers helped a lot and once you got the hang of it it got way easier to solve people problems Apple is an amazing company to work for! But...as a Specialist in a retail store just know that you will be on your feet on hard concrete all day long, no matter your age, wear shoes that support your feet, knees and lower back or you will have problems.The work/life balance is usually not optimal. Apple pays well and has lots of nice extras, but they do expect you to be available to them whenever they need you. I see exceptions made for students but not the rest.You’ll work with some pretty awesome people, Apple choses a diverse and interesting crew to operate its stores and I loved nearly everyone I worked with.Most stores are pretty busy, especially if they are the only Apple store for a long way in any direction. Launch days are exciting but rather insane, I liked them but some employees dread them. Just roll with it.I strongly recommend keeping cough drops on hand as during holidays and major events you’ll have to talk so much in a loud environment that your throat will eventually start to give out.If you are hard of hearing the work environment can be a challenge. It’s not just a loud environment but you also wear an earpiece connected to a walkie.The training process is thorough and you once you hit the floor it all falls into place. Apple has this down.Things change often and you are required and expected to adapt, find a way to manage your time so you can absorb it all.Apple does a decent job on developing it’s employees but it mostly falls to the management. I’ve personally done well at all the stores I worked at, but have seen favortism occur with  others from time to time.The right attitude, expectations and goals will get you far. Just remember that you don’t have to be a geek or nerd to work for Apple, they can teach you technology, they can’t teach you personality. Be prepared to engage, role play, collaborate and learn in a fast paced environment.I worked at different stores in different states, location and employees can make a huge difference to the experience you’ll have. Company shares same progressive values and promotes an open, diverse, feedback culture. It's truly one of the 'good' corporate companies out there. Probably the best. Culture is not always  reflected by retail management. There is no effort to recruit retail employees for corporate jobs despite the fact that retail is the bread and butter of the company. You may put in the time and give 200%, but sometimes it leads to nowhere. I wish I could say some nicer things, but after a year of giving everything I had, being one of the best employees my manager had ever seen (so they said), they let me go a month before the end of my contract and did not even flinch when I left sobbing. They laid over 100 of us off on the same day. Some say 'that's what we signed up for' and I guess they're right. It's a shame. i would have never left Apple.A typical day at work is answering calls and trying to sell Apple products. When you get good, you won't even have to try, and you'll start winning contests without trying either. The training is comprehensive, and it's easy to succeed. The customers can be difficult at times, but you have to learn how to talk to people who buy Apple products. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay on top .I learned that no matter what happens, do not give up on yourself. Go after what makes you happy, not just you're good at. Discrimination and retaliation are rampant and although brought to corporate's attention, they refuse to acknowledge the toxic environment built and maintained by AppleCare Enterprise/EDU leadership. In contrast to the 'fearless feedback' manta, team managers are allowed to carry out petty vendettas and pet employees are allowed to bully advisors with no consequences.  If you are in the 'good 'ol boys club' you are safe.  If you are not in the club, which most aren't, then you are treated like property, not people.  In spite of multiple claims from dozens of employees, human resources refuses to address or acknowledge the problem. The brand is great and great pride goes into the creation of the products, however the company lacks proper management. May managers lack the basic skills required for management. Benefits are good, but you better be ready to give it all or nothing because there is no work /life balance. Apple is a good company with good benefits and regular hours.  Not much overtime is offered or required.  Pay was good, but getting a chef job by working your way up is nearly impossible.  Some people helped each other out, but others were backstabbers who were trying to get ahead by making others look bad - a mixture of people just like any company.   Managers were pretty remote and not good at feedback, but chefs were nice. Typical day included keeping station clean and stocked, and serving customers, along with slicing vegetables and other prep work.  Everything related to clocking hours and pay is online.  Time card needs to be filled out online every 2 weeks.  Home computer access is essential because computer stations at work are always busy. it was a very fast past job that enjoyed alot kept me moving on my feet all ways had work to do house flew by in no time i was off great hard day of work It is a great company to work for. Lots of opportunities for growth. It is a difficult job although rewarding in many ways such as helping customers and overall benefits of the job even as a part time employee. I love Apple and it was such a pleasure to be able to work for a company that I love! They were understanding and very knowledgeable to learn from. I will definitely be interested in working for this company again when I have the chance They matched  up tp 4% in my 401k. We also got yearly stock grants. The company culture changed from store to store. As an expert it was my job to lead the store in revenue. I also had to be in the top 25% in my district.I averaged about $800,000 to over $1,000,000 in sales for almost every year. Even when I was part time in The first four years. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Great work environment, co-workers are wonderful. In an environment that is so fast paced there are always things to do. Opportunities for learning and development can feel stagnant. Working at Apple is very fast paced and often very stressful, but they are a very upright and honest company that offers an excellent work environment, with great benefits. Very Fast and rewarding Experience, most of project are global which bring the opportunity to shape skiils with a global audiance.Also a friendly place to work I worked in Apple Retail, but I found the job too late. During college this would have been a very nice part-time job to hold. However, post-college, when I am in need of enough income to support myself, this job is not cutting it. As a part-time employee you're very limited in your role unless you want to become a technician. If you want to do anything else because fix iPhones you just have to wait it out. You could be working a few years as a part-timer before being promoted to full-time. This is a gret job when you're in-betwen-gigs, but it's tough to make a career out of this, especially while trying to support yourself. The company itself is a great company to work for. The retail sector, however, feels like the black sheep of the family. You're an 'Apple employe,' but it doesn't really feel like you work for Apple. The days seem shorter on a typical day at Apple. If you aren't helping others in betting their lives with technology, you are bettering your knowledge in your role and future roles with their training program. Apple is a great company to work at if you are are interested in changing the world.  Work/Life balance is sometimes a challenge and most advancement is in Cupertino, CA. I could just keep throwing the adjectives out there about how accommodating, fun, intriguing, and generally just Good this job was to me.  I learned a lot, they're constantly training you, keeping you up to date on the current software, hardware, and mostly, customer service skills most psychiatrists couldn't dish out!Highly Highly recommended for any person remotely interested in tech, IT, computer sci, etc. At first, I was skeptical about working from home, but, once I started - day one - they made me feel right where I needed to be.  I cannot say enough good things, as they will teach you, guide you, and give you career moves, advice, as well as tons of cool perks and incentives to keep up the great work. At Apple, their main concern is with the customer and making sure they get the greatest experience buying the product. No one day is alike. Management cares about you and the work life balance and the hardest part about the job is the stressful high paced environment. There's lots of competition for full time positions and for the most part, everyone gets along with each other. I found the best parts of working there are the benefits you get as well as how much Apple contributes to local communities and charities. Great company to work for, great culture. Overall, great values and ethics. Advancement can be difficult depending on what you're seeking, however, there are great benefits overall. Fast paces, friendly, great environment but too little pay for such a competitive job. I appreciated the people and customers but it was really difficult to move up and get hours. Well run stores. You do get to learn new technology daily and have challenges. It was a fun place to work. It depends on who your bosses are - getting advancement opportunities can be difficult. I learned a lot working for Apple. I loved my AHA advisor job so much that I was working until the exact minute I went into labor. They had refused to give me maternity leave and only gave me 2 weeks off even though  I worked my life off for them. Staying late, taking all extra shifts, training people, coming in on my days off, and mind you I was pregnant! They gave me 14 days to return stating if I did not I would be demoted. I asked for 2 more weeks off after a week of being back so I could put my baby on a schedule, and they then fired me. I called and called trying to get my job back, I called for weeks and no one returned my phone calls and I could not get anyone on the phone. Everything was immediately terminated so anything that was not backed up on my computer was gone. I tried to get unemployment, and the lady had the nerve to tell them that I had to be denied because I did not try to get another position which was untrue! I was a single mother of 2 with a newborn and they snatched everything from me because I needed maternity leave. I ended up homeless and in a shelter from that. That was the worst experience because I love that company and their product, and they do not give any cares for us. When I first started working for Apple I enjoyed every minute of it.  However work life balance began to disappear, and job growth began to fade. Every location is different however you hear the same three complaints. The longer you work for the company the newer employees get paid more than you. Work life balance doesn't exists and the culture at apple is beginning to fade. I can say that, without a doubt, people at Apple care deeply about the world around them. Almost to a fault.Apple employees are generally helpful, friendly, happy, socially aware, and want to contribute to the world. Working for Apple is a bit of a guilty pleasure, especially given the current wage and quality of life crisis; Apple pays well, provides top notch benefits, and sets up all of their employees for success- this is not common among employers, especially in the SF Bay Area (where tech dominates and EVERY other industry is functioning as if it were still the 1980's).There is a dark side to Apple, however...There can be a lot of pressure to excel, to work, to go that extra mile... these things can, and have, burned people out pretty badly. People say that, the work sometimes never stays at work. there are certain project groups within Apple where this problem is pervasive. Beware, your work/life balance can suffer if you get on those teams.Otherwise, Apple is an amazing place to work. If you get hired, you're lucky. Had the opportunity to meet Steve several times.  Steve Jobs was the Greatest CEO Ever, he was not the evil genius the book portrays him to be, he was fantastic to work for.  Apple was the greatest experience of my life. Deal with lots of customers.Accept that management does not always know what they are doing.Stand on your feet all day.Unique job culture that emphasizes people as the main resource. Flexibility is not there. They always seemed short staffed so there was never an option to do overtime. It was pretty much you take the overtime or face the consequences elsewhere. Direct hires with Apple Inc get massive amounts of perks such as product discounts, gifts, prizes, and rewards. The job is your typical call center phone based tech support but the pay and benefits are phenomenal. The training is extensive and thorough and management goes above and beyond to assist you while on the floor with calls, as well as, with personal individual  issues with time off or anything position related. Management was great and you could tell they care about the careers and education of employees.Everyone is very helpful and always available if you are stuck or having problems with a customer Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. A typical day at work includes seeing 20 - 30 different individuals at the Genius Bar, diagnosing their issue and providing one or more solutions to suit their needs. Giving a receiving feedback is vital, so if you're sensitive or you do not desire constant growth, you won't enjoy it here.My team is a very connected and affectionate bunch. We give lots of hugs and encouragement to one another, and hang out beyond work hours. It remains professional because Apple knows how to hire people that fit the culture. So glad I work here. It is only my part time job, but I have turned down a few full time opportunities because I refuse to lose my spot here! its an ok job, pay is ok, work life balance not that great if you're full time. Room for advancement if you do your job. Part time employees get no paid time off. They do not stand behind their employees and regardless of the situation it is always your fault. Horrible path for any progression and make tons of false promises. Competitive but also a relaxed environment. Great compensation and benefits.  Hours can be long during project deadlines. Parking can be a stressful at times. Apple has an environment of learning to assist and progress.Apple shares it's vision consistently and works to deliver it daily.Working with others who are passionate about the product as you are creates an environment of support through learning and discovering solutions and understanding to get the most out of the product. Apple treats its contract workers like second class citizens. There is an air of secrecy and exclusivity about everything. Workers are discouraged from socializing with people from other teams and there are no opportunities for career development or mentorship. You need to be EXCEPTIONAL at time management skills, controlling calls, and able to proactively manage your metrics in order to succeed. If your calls average over 20 minutes, you will be assigned a second supervisor to actively monitor your calls and extra coaching.When a customer leaves a survey after their interaction with youIf you aren't getting BOTH...90% or better customer satisfaction metricAND90% or better issue resolution (did you resolve the customer's issueon that call) as deemed by the perception of the customer in their surveys, You will not be with Apple long. fun place to work. the staff there is great. you meet a bunch of great people while getting to work with great technology. it was a perfect job to gain experince when I was finishing school You can find a lot of enjoyment at Apple, primarily by developing relationships with coworkers. Apple retail prefers to hire externally for leadership, and struggles to create meaningful experiences to advance internal candidates. If you are not being hired as a manager or member of leadership, do not expect to advance beyond basic roles, unless you have management experience from elsewhere. New opportunities and versatile nature of work that kept me motivated everyday. My colleagues were friendly and helpful. My supervisor was really encouraging and supportive and helped me out whenever I needed it. Dynamic work enviornment, always thinking about how to place the customre first. Everyday brings new challenges.Fun working with competent emplyees, which helps take the stress out of everyday occurances.Stressful? Yes, but is was absolutely worth the expended energy to go above and beyond to make a customer experience fantastic. Being able to see true smiles on customer's faces is pricesless. I have never been hugged so many times in any other job I have ever had. That experience makes me so very happy, and I sleep well at night knowing I did the right thing for the customer. Apple is a great place to work, it is all about culture and driven collaboration. It is a place to learn and expand your horizons. I would recommend to a friend. Over all I loved working in Apple, I learned so many things I never thought would be of interest. I met so many people I will never forget. I now have a new family, and I now know what I deserve when it comes to my employer. Apple is very focused on the development of their team while still maintaining a high level of customer service and support. Every member of the leadership is evaluated  heavily before moving into their role to guarantee the success of every team. Apple was a great stepping stone in my IT career. They taught me how to troubleshoot apple systems and gave me more experience working with customers. A typical day was getting up and getting on my computer and having a meeting with my coach. Then id take calls for however long my shift was for then log off. The atmosphere and culture of the company is what keeps you coming back. Apple teaches you how to be an empath and how to maintain composure, which are priceless skills I will carry forever. Great place to start, if your looking for entry level work that will give you meaning and be a great starting point on really developing your resume. I would recommend this as a top 3 place to work in Austin. Amazing work experience , we learned about the newest technologies and apple software, assisted customers with trouble shooting and updates, I was able to optimize my phone experience. Apple is an amazing company to work for however the basis of the company in which it was founded is quickly dying. The culture shift is more about the product than the experience and the goals have moved away from the customer experience to what the customer could want. I see Apple hiring Apple care adviser paying under $15 /hour?  Common, you're a giant company why not pay fair hourly rate?  You're not in China.  And their minimum requirements are just equivalent to BS degree.They underpaid their employees to upper management get all the bonuses for keeping the budget low.  Ridiculous! Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Apple is a company that really focuses on personal growth and development. It genuinely feels like management always has your best interest at heart and is always working to make you a better person/employee. In receiving it fast paced and daily goals were set. Overtime was available. It was high pressure and competitive. The work was very mundane and repetitive. Apple focuses a lot on the customer while trying to build morale. It is a very challenging job and does offer a lot. There are very stressful times with Apple which can wear down quickly on anyone. Apple is a great company to work with and for, They pay very well and they offer plenty of opportunities to grow. The one downfall is that they are big on numbers and surveys. If you are not used to following strict metrics, this will not be a good fit. Other than that Apple has lots of perks and excellent benefits. third party company for apple , they forgot to pay me a check and this caused for me to relocate do to bills that could not be paid.all in all this company was a wonderful experience still to this day i know how to trouble shoot all apple products . Quite a learning process, poised for strong, long term growth. Leadership on the enterprise side learning as they go. Career track not clear, but, to be fair, that's incumbent on the individual to create. Working at Apple is a fun experience but requires a lot of tolerance to get by. Wouldn't recommend to a friend if they are looking for a career/reasonable work situation. There is a lot of bias in the warehouse that I worked at when it comes to race and how they are treated compared to how everyone was treated. A lot of issues can come up between employees. Overall however I had a somewhat great experience there and would most likely come back again if they asked, probably. I feel supported and provided with the proper resources to learn and grow within the company. As a result, I have grown as a person inside and outside of work. A typical day as a service technician is very busy. Most of the customers that you encounter are very angry, because their products either don't work or they work and they feel that they don't work (when their products are actually working fine.) What I have learned from this Job is how to think my way through problems and break them down to be solved or come to an adequate conclusion. I encountered many people from all walks of life with this job and it has taught me a lot about human beings in general regardless or race, religion, or sexual orientation, and that is everyone has similar mannerisms when a device that Is in their pocket is not working properly. I used to have to mentally prepare myself for work, for the mental and some what emotional stress that the day may bring. The hardest part of the Job was dealing with the customers, some of my coworkers were called horrible derogatory terms out their name to be little them. Its good part time job, wouldn't make it my full time again with out a plan. Health benefits and stock options are the good side of the job, customers, not being compensated enough to deal with the general public and its abuse is the down side. In some cases you meet great and interesting people to work with. Watch your 6 like a G6. Like a G6. Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6. Watch your 6 like a G6. You never know when someone wants to be sly like a G6. Be above them, be above yourself. But don't stoop to those that are after your 6! Super busy with lots of customers.  Learn to work with creative people and collaborate with them to accomplish various goals and solve problems.  The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with customers, especially the nice ones, and the hardest part is working in a retail setting and dealing with unhappy customers. good place to work but expectations are high and the praise received for doing a good job is forced and fake. i would rather get no praise for doing my job in an adequate then fake praise to try and get me to work harder. I was hired to work iPhone and iPad issues with only a 15 minute turnaround time allowed.  It sucked!!  It was like working in a call center with idiot Apple users asking questions on how to use their phone. If you enjoy working in a silo, horrible Management that will degrade you and see their best employees thrown in the trash, employees that will treat you like you don't exist....then Apple is the place for you!If you are considering working for Apple, get in, stay for a year or two to pad your resume and then get out of their before they eat you up from the inside. To this day many years after leaving I still speak and hang with people from Apple there a family there and I’m extremely thankful for those people in my life. I know that they will be apart of my life always. I learned better UX design skills with my short time. The most difficult part of the project was forming a way to make my own type of landing page, based on the assets given. Was fun for a while but mgmt. was too busy doing other stuff than caring about company morale. Which is fine for a business that doesn't pride itself on it's people being the something or other of the company but this company often claimed otherwise. Grueling commute from Oakland, no free lunches, spread out. Overall job was fun/good, but seemed to be 24/7. Over-reliance on email. Proprietary products (bug tracker, Scrum board, etc). I loved working here!  When I started I had never used anything Apple and their training was amazing.  The culture at Apple is fantastic, no other job has compared. Very fast paced place to work. You get to interact with an abundance of people which really gives you a diverse set of people skills that many employees do not always get the opportunity to obtain. It's a very creative setting, and everyone is super supportive. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. great jlob I love working there the sups are fine and the pay is good. over time is always available. the company are great to ther're employes. I love the company. If you like your life and happiness don’t work here.  The management was a joke!  They will take all you have an ask you for more. Apple makes good products but when you work as a retail employee you are the infantry of the company a.k.a. disposable! The only thing I did not like is that there was no benefits there. We had to get our own benefits from an outside source and that is very expensive so I did not have any benefits by choice. other then that Apple is a good place to work and a nice environment. I had a great time working at Apple, Learned a lot about their products as well as assisted customers the same. A great and innovative company to work for. Great role and company. Can be hard to navigate and highly political. Low ceiling after you rise to a senior position. Lots of ego from people that should be humble. Overall, Apple was a great company to work for. At the time, however, management was subpar and the culture was loose. If given a chance to start again, I would consider it deeply. Apple was a great company to work for great compensation, remote working, team building. The only down side was that many of the customers were rude or had unfix-able problems at least on the Technical Support side. Not a fun place to work at. Lots of discrimination between FTE and contractorsManager does not motivate employees.Culture is very bad.Support projects Exceptional benefits are not worth the trade off for work/life balance they claim to care about. Despite what management says, you are pressured to sell or life at work becomes very difficult and stressful. There are ‘cliques’ between those who play the game and those who truly challenge or ask why. My first tech job. I worked in MobileMe, now called iCloud. This was a live chat queue that shared the phone queue building with Apple Care and iTunes support.  I supported sync services and took payments. You helped three people at a time, and it was stressful. Eep if you were not skilled in certain apps and the HT articles didn't make sense. Cool Place to work at. Management was ok. Hired people from outside instead of hiring within. Great training programs. learned a lot about customer service on the retail side. Expectations of the employees were often communicated too late, resulting in an environment where one constantly felt unsure of whether they were doing a good job. Part-time employment is the best. You can tap in to healthcare & some other great benefits. You also have a 'set-schedule'. You will accrue sick-time. But you don't get vacation or holiday pay. Very diverse culture in the store, even in Hingham, MA! Weekly touch points from senior management to ALL retail employees, generally a video from the SVP of retail. Cutting edge technology in a retail environment. The political bubbles were too much. It's nice to have worked at Apple, but the games people had to play to get things done was too much. I was happy to find another place to work. Company is amazing and offers great pay and benefits. Work life balance is amazing. They are flexible with scheduling. There are a lot of employees so you really have to shine through. Apple was a great job and offered good benefits and discount and treated employee great. I worked from home it was great for awhile. but i would have loved to see what it would be like to work in the stores Working at Apple was awesome I learned a lot about the product, which helped with assisting the customers with their technical issues. Management was always helpful and would always let us know they were there for us. The hardest part of the job was not being able to resolve issues for some customers. I enjoyed coming to work because we were like family there. Great work environment, organized, professional, fun and fast paced. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable, with a willingness for others to succeed. They don't leave no room for error and if you go into the hospital for any reason they have you as a no-call no-show even if you call the first day but then call every day that you were in there they'll put you as a no hire which is kind of messed up if you have medical papers in medical problems like I did I went into pre-term labor so I was pretty easy especially through Vault through stormy Stressful, underappreciated, no room for growth, management does not listen. Keep in mind, I have not worked there for five years but my experience there has influenced a lot of my decision making since then when it has come to my career choices. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Since Steve left us the retail area of Apple has suffered greatly. Not at first but within 2-3 years after his death. Customers get less services than ever, wait times and store traffic has increased to ridiculous numbers. There simply is no work life balance. And even closing in on 10 years $41k is the best they can do ... FYI my annual reviews look and sound amazing on paper. So much any other company would’ve promoted me multiple times. My fault for settling I suppose. Even Jobs said, “Never settle”. Can find great opportunities if you are willing to put in some hard time and wait for it. Tech Culture is not for everyone and can be very stark.  They do appreciate input and people who can be creative and think outside the box. There are good people to work with when you get past some big personalities. great experience to start but the politics completely take over once you are involved with leadership and trying to move up. if you are not bringing your fake personality to work everyday you will never move up. Competitive Pay, Great Benefits, Amazing People, Great Work, Awesome Opportunities, Excellent Experiences, Great atmospheres in a beautiful store, no matter where you're working! 但是内部族裔斗争激烈晋升制度不靠谱工作面太窄，发展空间不大公司福利一般，还不如一些小公司公司文化保密 不被认可 While working at Apple the pay was wonderful and they helped pay my internet bill. I worked from home for three years taking calls back to back everyday. You are always by yourself except for the ability to chat with friends and management. After getting off a call yuh are expected to immediately take another call, this was difficult because I would still need to finish notes on the previous call. Apple is very fast paced and not for the faint of heart. Apple is an incredibly supportive company to work for. There is an incredibly strong workplace culture and a very strong sense of unity among the employees.Apple is invested in the growth of their employees in technical ability and knowledge as well as in artistic pursuits including music creation, photography and painting/sketching. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the people and learning my job.  Apple is a great company to work with.  I just had a contract job with them that completed. Overall a good company to work for. Your experience with the company will highly be reflective with your management team. The work in the retail stores is fast paced and at times a little crazy. Great place to work very competitive shape skills required for the company. Everyday is something new which is a great thing. New goals are set each and everyday Apple gives you the opportunity to develop and  groom you to future position within or outside the company. The environment that Apple has created allows you to enjoy each other and customers. Apple has a fantastic workplace culture, a thorough training plan, and great benefits. I liked all the managers and felt a genuine sense that they not only did their best to be everything they needed to be to upper management - but in meeting OUR needs as employees and people. The demand for excellence they set was a high bar but they provided most of the tools to be successful at hitting that bar. The only reason I left was because I had other ambitions outside of the job and had to eventually make a one-or-the-other decision. Even though I was a PT employee, I felt the demand was great, especially because Apple would require temporary FT schedules during Apple's peak seasons. But that said, and to Apple's credit, I've also never worked for a company that was so generous with benefits as to provide the same FT benefits as a PT employee. Just be prepared to fully dedicate yourself to the position and constantly educate yourself on their products and services. In the end, I didn't just learn a lot about Apple - I gained important insight from the people I helped and grew a little bit in the process. It was fun to be able to tell people I worked at Apple. But in all honesty its a retail job with little to no career advancements. When it comes down to open positions every employee acts like a hungry piranha and everyone applies for the SAME 1 position. I was passed over for newer employees even when I had years of experience in a certain role. Moving up into management is even harder. Apple cut off their internship to harvest corporate employees from the retail stores 1 year before I graduated and that cut off that inside track to a REAL career at Apple. Its a good retail job for a short time. Its not sustainable for having a family with small children. Its not sustainable for having days off with your spouse. Every employee has to work 1 weekend day. So you end up with Wednesday off and Sunday off. good luck hanging with your friends Saturday when they tail gate and you have to go fix toilet dropped iPhones. I've been here for about 3 years now & I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. From the management, to culture, to benefits, it is an all around great company to work for Apple is a great opportunity to start a job and rurn it into a career. They offered good hours and i never had to worry about missing work because  they offered overtime frequently There is a reason everyone tries to get in with Apple and tends to stay for long periods of time. With the right management this job can become a life long career in Retail. Apple’s pay is very fair in retail. They offer amazing benefits and I had worked as a part time employee and let me tell you that I have still to see benefits like the ones I had at Apple working full time positions for other companies! I would have stayed but we begin getting some interesting managers after the really good ones left our store and this was one of the reasons I left. The second reason is that while part time was great I still needed a full time position and in Apple retail that was very competitive. I got offered a full time job at another company and kept my part time for a few months until it got to difficult time management wise as the other company began to require more time. Apple as a company itself does have a really good work culture but be warned they I’ll spoil you for any other company that doesn’t treat you the same! Working for Apple changed everything. So detailed and thorough and progressive was their training that I have yet to find another company which equals in passion and team-building. Very well-compensated (from '08 to '13 anyway). Best benefits, stock purchase program made me a huge chunk of money besides my regular compensation. The best job I've ever had. If you enjoy the virtual call center environment then this position is for you. If not then look further. it is a very isolated position. all support is virtual and much less than immediately available.  to be successful you must learn to use the Tech data bas which is so convoluted that searching Google usually results in a faster answer to your inquiry. Fun and loving place to work just be you because they have people from all kinds of backgrounds from which they pull all of your experiences and just love of the product I learned how to troubleshoot, upgrade hardware, update software and some minor repair for Mac's, Macbooks, iOS Devices, Apple TV's, and Time Capsules(WiFi Router Storage Devices). I mostly enjoyed becoming Apple Account Security Certified for iCloud and iTunes accounts and Chat Support. I was then able to help more Customers with more issues and provide resolution on my own. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Apple has a unique work culture. People from all walks of life work there. They pay employees well and they offer many opportunities for growth and learning. Working at Apple gives you great skills and education opportunities that will set you up for future success. The onboarding of new employees is a slow process because they focus on culture fit more than knowledge. It is a good start if you haven't had a job in a while.  Training varies and is not consistent.  It depends on who you have as a trainer.  You can meet lots of people from different cultures and backgrounds.  Jobs can get monotonous.  Pay is low considering Apple is making lots of money off work of employees.  There  are good people working there and there are people there that shouldn't be working there.  Attitudes vary.  Hard to get hired on permanently. Its typical retail, don't let the videos fool you, its retail, as retail as it gets!!! No future, no growth, only the select few who have no goals grow, if you have potential they dont advance you, they will tell you to leave apple it is a great company to move to management quickly. If you are career minded, the rigor of Apple may be for you. It is a very strict environment and not everyone can handle being micro managed. Apple is a awesome place to work home or at the office, dependable representatives always there for you to help support with any questions. They hire almost anyone if you know about computers and have customer service experience. I enjoyed talking to an expert about my posture and how my desk should be structured. The cafeteria had a lot of options. The office part of the job was repetitive and not stimulating.The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling. Apple is a good place to get a start in retail and/or information technology.  It is fast paced and can be a fun environment.  Apple does offer advancement for specialists, but for managers, the options are limited.  Management runs the gamut from really good to bad. Some of them are brought in from the outside and are young and don't have any operational experience.  Overall, it was a good experience. Great place to work, fun and great culture love the people best tech ever. I would love to go back if the they would bent on the times for working parents. Enjoyed working there although during launch time, was expected to put in 14+ hours of work on daily basis for 3-5 weeks. Overall, colleagues are good and environment is positive. Apple is a very good work position. I want to advance more in my career so this is why I am looking for a different position. I want to be higher up and be able l further my career. The job is great, its just like working in a call center or office except you get to work from the comfort of your own home. All the benefits of not having to travel to work. The hardest part of the job is just working alone and being at home all day. In this position you need a quite room or place with a closed door. If you like being at home and not having to meet or talk to people in person, this job is perfect for you. Overall this is a good job, great company to work for with plenty of benefits and opportunities . Just wish I could work away from home once and a while and meet ppl. Great job , big focus on peer relations , not everyone is your friend so you Have to fake your way through things , great company tho. I’m sure each store is different. I would recommend anyone to work here. Just focus on what you have to get done and don’t get tied up in the politics. Fast-paced environment that can be fun and upbeat. There is not a lot of time to collect yourself after a stressful customer interaction or if you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. Take a sip of water to stay hydrated and get yourself back on the sales floor. it was great experience working for apple inc. professional management team, clean and secure place to work but the security is a bit tough , i didn't like it. Clock in Check email communications from store and corporateLead in facilitating Corporate initiativesConnect with team members and assure training requirements are met.Connect internal and external customers Help team members overcome obstacles in their interactionProvide coaching momentsConnect with the business team and make sure we are reaching our revenue and connection goal for the day and week.Relay what was done throughout the day to closing manager to be communicated in the End Of Day ReportApple says its most important part is the people. Apple was a great opportunity to begin with, but once they started laying off teams the increase in call volume became overwhelming. Also, they do not offer an opportunity for employment if you have already worked for them before. Apple hires so many creative people! You don’t need to know about technology to be considered a position in apple retail. The retail locations look for people that have integrity and are passionate. Working at an Apple store comes with tons of benefits, the main one being the exposure to new tech and discounts on expensive products. But it was also a great opportunity to work on personal development, and the benefits were pretty good. Enjoyable environment to work. Very professional that motivates you to go to work. I like how flexible they are and always work with you. Always opportunities to move up in this company. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. A typical day was to answer calls with only about 6-15 second spacing and provide troubleshooting and support to CPU and IOS as well as other customer needs. Apple has lots of opportunities just not for the outsider. As much as they like to make you feel equal there are many instances of being treated as NOT an equal. If you are a contractor you will be treated as such. Just accept it. Job was easy enough but pay was not compensation enough for job. bad enviornment bad  management. Apple did not pay well . That is all i will say again they do not pay well. Non stop repairing laptops, 30 minute lunch breaks, and paperwork.  I worked in a warehouse and was paid less than what I was worth due to having a Apple License thru a staffing agency plus i was part time with 25 hrs a week.  You do the math on why I left lol Been here for less than a year and its a great fast paced company. Got promoted in six months to technician. Always on your feet moving and learning about recent releases. It is a great job to have, but you must know good time management. It has great benefits. Hardest part of the job is the back to back calls. Most enjoyable part is working from home and dealing with customers everyday, being able to help. Apple, Inc. Is one the greatest jobs you can ever work for. Down to the pay, management, employees, benefits, etc. It’s a great environment with growth opportunities. The environment at Apple does not suit everyone. It is fast paced and fun and you learn valuable skills that are translatable to any industry, however, there are a lot of negatives that people do not see from the outside. The culture is great at times but it is fickle and does not provide much support when things aren't going well. I worked at the apple warehouse using a variety of tools ie forklift pallet jack. Data entry update stock status.Pull orders pack orders transfer to shipping dept. Working for Apple is challenging, exciting and rewarding.  The AHA positions however only allow a limited ability to grow within the company.  Apple is a wonderful company to work for but if looking for a professional career with lots of career options with a career path and growth; you must be willing to relocate to work within the main office locations. Words do not describe how much of an amazing company this is. From the people around you to the pay to the quality of life. Everything about Apple was amazing. Everyone starts usually as a part-time employee but always has the opportunity to work up to full time. Also another great thing is that you can expand your role to go from sales floor to support and help fix problems. I would recommend Apple to everyone Honestly, just dont work at Apple retail. You know there are better things you can do to advance yourself and working there will just derail your career. If you want to be extremely stressed constantly,and have the feeling of 'I hate my job but I'm afraid to leave because of the benefits' than go for it but there's nothing 'special' you learn. Its just a retail job, but pays a little better than other mall jobs but is much, much more demanding. If you want to sacrifice your own sanity for money, do it. It was a great place to work. The warehouse was very hot, they had no fans. I came to work with great attitude everyday, n was very happy to work there. I was doing prototype work for Apple products. I feel that I learning more seen I get this job, I'm glad to support engineering, like rework , repair, building test systems and testing CPU and other Apple new products. I loved working for apple.  if I had not of gotten sick I would still be working for them.  imtrying ti get back to them currently. the training course was easy to follow and the reps that train you are always here to help. A typical day at apple is very welcoming and promising. I learned how to handle the smallest to biggest customer complaints and was able to use my resources there to figure out a resolution as fast as i can. The management was very supportive of your needs and will stretch miles in order to secure your happiness at the store. Apple creates a highly collaborative environment that promotes creativity and innovation.  The culture at Apple allows for input and impact in a client-centric environment.  Apple is filled with passionate, smart and dedicated employees that make you want to do your life's best work. 8 years flew by. I was getting too comfortable and had to grow. I miss the Steve Jobs days and they hired many people very fast that don't fully know the culture. Still awesome. Once you leave you will miss how much Apple spoiled you. Politics definitely gets in the way of every workplace and you will have those managers that will drive you crazy. Overall...life changing for the better and very inclusive and your voice matters. the job is not for you if you have children its not flexible if you would like knowledge on technology or are good with technology you would be a good fit Apple pays above average for call-center work and generally requires no prior experience. However, Apple is such a large company that advancement opportunities are scarce, and unless you are doing the work of 3 jobs, you are not considered for promotions.Apple's attendance and PTO policies are refreshing and beneficial, and there are routine bonuses and rewards for longevity and good work.There are limited overtime opportunities—'the needs of the business' is the common saying—which means when it is offered, it is on a 'mandatory-not-mandatory' basis and is technically not allowed to impact annual performance/merit increases and yet it definitely factors in.For those with families or outside commitments, the work-life balance is difficult to maintain, and the changing policies internally about how to resolve situations is becoming more and more about the bottom line and less about stellar customer service, leaving to a very sour taste in one's mouth at the end of the day.Change is the rule, not the exception—in my first two years, I had 6 different team managers, and this is not uncommon, as one is often shifted in to different queues or skill groups based on 'the needs of the business' and without regard for one's interests or skills. Get stuck with a bad manager and it practically ends your career, get grouped with a good one and you will shoot to the moon if they don't promote them first for being so great. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. As far as retail it’s foesnt get much better.  The starting rate is good, there’s growth opportunities from within, it’s a culture that’s close knit but professional and there are plenty of work perks! This is a great company to work for. The training are available for each person to take their development in their own hands. This company is full of resources for professional development and growth. Fun working there   People where friendly good environment. No drama workplace. Work was easy. I just wish the would pay more money then I would of stayed I enjoyed my time at apple started as a contractor and enjoyed my  10 years. I was given the oppertunity to grow and be pushed to develop news skills and knowledge.I would certainly return if an oppertunity arose. As an iOS Technician, a lot of work is put on your shoulders and it feels like it'll never let up during the workday. While I was there, there were a lot of changes going on and a lot of stress was added on top of advisors. Many people lost their jobs on their own volition simply due to the stress added.However, that said, this was years ago. Today? I don't know. But while I was there before those changes, it was a great place to work remotely. Fun atmosphere, great pay, great people. Lot of innovative minds.Hope they backtracked on the workload they put on them. You will meet amazing people while working at Apple. The compensation and hours however do not in any way match the high stress and demands of the role. If you have prior technical expertise, lower your expectations for this job drastically. Take measures to avoid burnout. Your education, skills, time and sanity are much more valuable elsewhere. I had a tough time during my tenure at Apple for a lot of reasons.  Management didn't support me when I went through a difficult life transition.  My work quality stayed the same, despite a lot going wrong in my personal life, but I was attacked by coworkers, and management allowed it, while I was out on an approved leave. I worked as a transcriptionist from home, so I could work whenever I wanted and wherever I wanted. I could balance between my life and job. The fun part was I could work freely, like I didn't need to dress up in order to work. The culture at the store was very uplifiting. Everyone supported each other. Communication was daily given from all the to the top of the company down to the retail employees. Voices felt heard and everyone got along for the most part. Nice environment to work, not overwhelming job, relax, opportunity to exercise, learning experience superb.My experience was short since it was a one year deal to improve the the specific tool. Apple offers outstanding benefits and works with great products. However if you are going into a technical support role and are not a people person, keep in mind that a apple is a very large company. There are a lot of customers. This translates into a lot of social interaction with so many different types of people that for someone severely introverted his could become a problem. Loved working for an Apple Vendor site. Will be very happy when I get a chance to work at an actual Apple building.  Moved back to California to be around family and to work with Apple. Currently trying to get in one of the only two Apple official call centers in the US. (Sacramento Ca,) I love the products and their ideals. The environment was super friendly and relaxed. No judgement what so ever. Work was fun to do and I also loved talking to the customers all around the world as well.... Apple is an amazing place to work. Its fun, fast paced and has great benefits. Management could be better. There is a lot of micro managing. They have fair breaks, hour lunch, and fair pay. If you don't like crowds this isn't the place for you. i loved working for applelearned a lot about ipads, ipods, iphones and macsit was fast paced so unlimited calls in queueit was a great job but hard work Apple is NOT the best place if you have a family. Also, ALL who work in the Family Room are under paid. Especially, for the New York City market.The product speaks for itself and the team are far more qualified then the title is given to them. Bumping up the pay and better scheduling would knock it out the park. I'm sure I am echoing plenty of others when I mention how great it was to work at Apple. The benefits, the culture, what the company believes, etc. is all the best of the best. IBEX provided a very fun, relaxed environment based on Apple's policies. The guidelines were made clear to us and we had plenty of training. We were able to ask questions whenever needed. The day begins with applying  safety gear, then  contiunes into checking data table for repairs or assabmely. The repair room which I was stationed was very engaged in electrical repairs and  calibrations.One of the most intriguing and thought-provoking postions I have ever held.I highly recommend to apply to anyone intrested in Electronics. Great company to work for. Learning opportunity with good group of people. It is face paced work environment which sometimes can become stressful. ... -Relaxed and fun working environment-Inventory management and trained new workers-Nice workplace and easy going co-worker-A little dusty-Great Boss Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. The best job that i've ever had!!  I left Apple to pursue a full-time position, but I wish that I had kept it as a part-time job.  The culture was magnetic and the managers empowered workers to be better individuals before being better workers. You can't beat Apple when it comes to jobs providing great benefits to its employees. However, the culture of the company has changed and advancement within the company is harder now that they hire from outside sources. Feedback regarding reasons for not advancing current employees is terrible and it is starting to wear on peoples morale. If your are looking for a great opportunity and challenge, Apple is the place. My time there was wonderful. It helped me grow is so many ways. I would recommend this work environment to anyone . Love the perks, but the pay isn't that great when compared to other companies. Everyone I have I know who has left the organization is making much more money after their departure. i learned how to assemble an iphone and to know and analyze the problem .the workpleace is very bright and comfortable..the culture we respect each other opinions and open suggestions,the hardest part of the job is that you know how to handle the situations and explain everything about the parts of the phone when its being failed to test and there is no power...I enjoyed working here becase you  can meet a lot of different cultures who are working here. Apple took a chance on me when no one else would. I rewarded them by becoming as asset to their management team and developed myself into a tremendous person and employee. Definitely not what I was expecting. I was told during the first meeting with all the new hires that we would be able to work towards becoming a chat support agent instead of a phone support agent. I was under the impression I would be able to decide to take on a chat support position in which I was mislead because that position was not offered. I didn't like the 2 week training, it seemed difficult to understand and they do not really help you as much or give you all the resources to help you learn. My days could be long, but it was fun always having new challenges. You get to travel and play w neat products all day. Depending on your position you may be providing demos to the public. At Apple work from home you are engaged with your team and TM you learn a lot in training and its fun. The hardest may be some angry customers every now and then. The pay is good and the schedules are great to. Apple does an amazing job at hiring amazing people! Everyone gets along so well! From the Specialists to managers, everyone is great! You felt like an equal to everyone, no matter their status or position. A good place to work where you will learn a lot. Benefits are great and so is the culture. Management is hit or miss, but probably just as many good managers as bad... While Apple continues to rake in billions of dollars quarterly, its employees do not share in that wealth. Internal growth is stagnant, pay increases are subpar or nonexistent, and the expectations and responsibilities continue to skyrocket. Peaceful start to everyday, with a catch up via your managers. Personal Huddles were always happening, so every employee was set up for success. I learned how to interact with customers of all temperaments, and personalities. Our managers were well trained, and eager to teach. There is no culture like that of Apple, besides maybe google. Everyone got alone, and enjoyed each-others company. The most difficult part of my job, was the sheer number of guests in our store at any given time. Management of your time, and capabilities was absolutely huge. some people were just looking around, while others were there to purchase. I was a big part of the store, as I was the first contact for guests as they entered. It was my job to probe, detail, and accurately designate specialists, who could cater to their needs. The most enjoyable part of my employment at Apple, were the long lasting relationships I still have to this day. I didn't work at all when I was employed there. I just enjoyed the loving company I was surrounded by. Apple used to be a good company to work for, now they are mostly just 'cool' with very little substance to back up the hype. Speaking from my experience in my department specifically, it was not a good place to work day-to-day, let alone try to build a career. They preached innovation, creativity, and ambition, but only encouraged it from certain people/certain personality types. A lot of blatant nepotism regarding promotions and career-building opportunities as well. Tons of micromanagement regarding basic functions like bathroom breaks or stepping away from the desk to provide peer coaching, etc, as it pertained to productivity metrics. When confronted point-blank about the discrepancy between annual review/raises and the abrupt cost of living increases (in a fast-growing metro area where they no doubt got tons of tax breaks for building their 'second HQ'), management was forced to admit that the cost of living here is not taken into consideration at all, the pay scale is tied to the average salary for the job title in question. So it's not as competitive as they'd like you to believe. This probably didn't impact executive & more specialized employees very heavily, but for the call-center oriented departments it became challenging to make bills and still feel a part of the quality of life & culture that Apple is so proud of. I started out super enthusiastic about being part of the company but grew disillusioned over time due to poor management at many levels & general 'replaceable cog in the machine' attitude toward customer-facing staff. its good  for  first time job Experian's  but the problem is that its not a permanent job and its only contract for one year and then they going to lay out the employee Fun and really interesting people to work with.  Some managers are better than others but overall there are some really cool things to do. Just dont expect anything to come easy. hard work never hurt anyone. And they look at more than your technical skills. being friendly goes along way. they are a really good company to work for, a lot of different amenities, a lot of good people to work for.  Supervisors are really nice, just overall a really good place to work Apple prepares you for the position with great training that you can carry through into your future, however, without above average organizational and time management skills you will easily get overwhelmed. It’s also a call center position where you will need to understand every call is going to begin negatively every day. This can be an over-whelming experience for any person that doesn’t thrive in a fast-paced work environment. There are a lot of great details that come with working for such a well respected company, but there are HUGE politics that come with working in a retail location. It’s a great place to work as a part timer, but working as a full timer, everything changes - the magic and the appeal fades away very quickly. Work-Life balance is a constant topic while on the clock but good luck getting time off if you work at The Genius Bar... it’s a little bit more lax when you work in the Front Facing Sales area of the store. Most leaders are ‘okay’ but there are several of them that are Snakes. They don’t care about your life and they could care less about what’s happening outside of the store, although they’ll pretend like they do while on the clock. If you choose to work for this company do so with eyes wide open... they’re just like thousands of other Retail environments out there - don’t let them fool you. Leading the virtual best buy team to higher sales on apple products. Face to face customer interaction and selling them the full apple experience. Most fun- seeing the customer walk away with a great experince Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. It was a good place to work with good management, but it was hard to advance with a career. They emphasized and taught us certain skills that were applicable to everyday life. They frequently checked in on the progress of their employees. Apple was one of the greatest places to work. The family atmosphere and family culture can never be beat. Leadership encourages you to take strides and go out of your comfort zone to further develop yourself. The management team supports you 100% and never undermines you. They are flexible with shift changes and needing time off. The best company I have ever worked for. Great experience for a great company. The pay is fair and the hours are manageable. You learn a lot of skills working here and it is a great work environment. A typical day includes staring out reviewing important changes.Then your role can change from helping face to face customers to working on repairs for apple products When starting at Apple, everything is amazing. When you're there for a few years and you have been talking to people that work for 'the others', you feel left out. Salary is usually lower, benefits are worse, perks are a lot worse, but you're expected to do the same or more. The benefit they keep dangling in front of you is: you work for Apple! That only carries you so far.The amount of opportunities at Apple is endless though. There is a culture of 'try it' when an idea is launched, which is refreshing. The last few years I feel this has been going down though. I've worked for Apple for almost a year now and it has been the best experience I've had with a retail job. While I don't work in a retail Apple Store, I still get the full Apple benefits while having the freedom to manage myself within my location. This company is very supportive and has a great work culture for its employees, it truly makes you feel valued to work for Apple. A great company to work for. They manage people, not numbers. I enjoy my time at Apple, I just wish there was a way to achieve a better work life balance. Apple is a good company to work for. Notice that I said GOOD. They're not great but not terrible either. It's the kind of job that you will get sick of fast... I'm talking about an at home tech support advisor. The pay is very competitive. They have health, dental and vision benefits and various stock options.Management is a hit and miss. It depends who you answer to. Some managers are great and others are awful. There isn't much consistency as far as call quality is concerned. Different managers have different expectations and you switch managers often. What one manager will praise you for, another may not. There is a ton of micromanagement.Schedules are terrible. You have a shift bid every three months and it's based on performance so if you aren't in the top few percent, don't expect to get a shift that you want.Seniority means nothing. New hires come in and get better shifts than someone that's been there for 20 years. Of course new hires will perform better (for a short while), they are new and excited.  There isn't much room for growth, despite what they tell you. The best part is being able to work from home in your pajamas. Working for apple is a great experience. my issues aren't with the company, just the role specifically. Customer service is very demanding and hard to do anywhere. A general technical support job designed to keep clients in limbo between departments without any resolution. This job probably works for some people, but the changes in hours without notice and support system just wasn't an effective use of my time. As retail jobs go, Apple is probably one of the best.  The hours are horrible (like any retail job) and Apple Stores can be really, really loud places to work.  Your coworkers are the best part of your job - they are eclectic and come from everywhere.  You will make life-long friends at Apple, but jumping from Apple Retail to Corporate is very hard, the hours are long, and customers can be the best or  the worst - you'll change a customer's life in an hour by solving a work problem they had no idea they could resolve on their own and the next customer is yelling at you for selling them a $3000 laptop that doesn't work (which just happened to fall into the pool, but they'll never admit to it).  The stock option plans and health benefits are amazing - especially for same-sex couples.  People also like the discounts that Apple extends to employees, but I view them as necessary since pay tends to be great for retail, but horrible for technical or skilled positions. I'm a contractor. So, Its not much difference between a consulting company. Its like working from offshore even though you're in US. Full time employees meet us(contractors) once a week. Great Customer ServiceHow to probe and multitaskGreat management skills and coaching.Learning how to multitask and use resources.Working for this company was great, fun and open minded. It’s not a bad gig as long as you stay distanced from becoming too in love with the company. They promote culture and loving your job but it’s still a business and money is the bottom line. This job doesn’t set you up for any type of technical work outside of Apple as anytime you want to progress in those fields it’s seen as a conflict of interest Overall, work days were relaxed yet productive, with projects meeting deadlines on time without stressing out employees.  I learned new insights on corporate structures and working as part of a team of dedicated individuals. Apple is an exciting place to work, the culture is really focused on its people. Empowering their people and creating a great work life balance for their people. At the end of the day it is retail, and though there are many opportunities to grow you will be dealing with an unpredictable and time consuming retail schedule. It was an excellent time working for Apple however poor management and questionable rules, ethics, and procedures make the experience difficult to appreciate. A typical day in Apple Retail is hectic as heck. Honestly, you get used to it after a while. It's actually really fun, if you have a great, close-knit team, like I did. The overall culture is relaxed and open, which is nice. The management team can sometime be non-existent, until it's time to harp on you for messing things up. There also seems to be a disconnect between management and corporate. Apple is known for its secrecy, and that sometimes makes things almost impossible to do or understand when handed down from corporate or management, because you don't really get any details, and are expected to sort them out on the fly. Also, things can get lost in translation, because leaders aren't always on the same page, either. I learned a LOT about who I am, what things I'm good at, and working with people. I also learned how to take criticism, customer anger, and questions like a champ, not internalizing them, and putting the energy into providing solutions and doing better work. The worst part is the idea of work/life balance. It is pretty much non-existent. I had several teammates have to choose between work and school by managers. If you're a technician, don't expect to have weekends free, nor a social life, because they are sacrificed to the Apple gods for you. Again, I've had multiple teammates who almost missed their children being born, and other events simply because they couldn't get someone to cover their shift or time off. Thank goodness for our teams willingness and flexibility with each other, because that has saved us more than once. If you have any other talents,  like music, art, or the like, expect not to have a hobby anymore, because you belong to Apple Retail.Benefits for working at Apple are good, however. Cadillac health coverage, stock purchase discounts, education reimbursement, and some other discounts (like public transit) are amazing. It is a great company to hold onto for the long haul, though. Just be ready to work for it. Repair, Diagnose Apple products by the help of different hardware and software and also provide customer service, I learn lot of software and hardware parts here, but they don't pay that much, but the work atmosphere is nice. Not the greatest experience working for Apple. training went too quickly, didn't allow for different learning styles, expected immediate understanding of complex concepts, no time allowed to review and understand training. Also, job pushed selling of warranties over helping people with technical issues. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Apple has been a great place to work for the past 5 years.  My only complaint would be the lack of advancement opportunities.  There is not much room to grow as must positions are considered lateral moves. Apple is filled with fun people and offers great benefits.  They will hire a whole team of full-time people off the streets instead of promoting from within.  That's why I left. Apple is great as a company, but it is even better as a company to work for. There are many different positions and groups. there is room for growth and advancement in each. and management is setup to prevent the failure of an employee. its a wonderful place to work Salary was a huge pro and the remote job at home worked fine for the family and business needs. The scheduling and management were the cons of this job. The job is very demanding and you have to be at your best 24/7, 365. I gets pretty taxing after a while. Depending on the leadership team, asking for time off can be treated like stealing. That being said, I was there for over a decade and I learned a lot as a leader. The Apple store is a great place to work as a retail store. But it's just that- a retail store. Do NOT consider working at the Apple store if you have aspirations of transitioning a job in the store to Apple Corporate- that NEVER happens. Instead, go to school and get a software or hardware engineering degree and THEN apply to Apple Corporate.The pay is low, it's hard work, and you'll get yelled at a lot by angry customers.That said, the people who work there are all (generally) great, it does have nice benefits (you get the same fancy health care plan that Corporate employees get, for example), and there's a good team atmosphere.Just don't take a job here unless you're interested in a career in retail. There's very little opportunity for advancement. This college program is highly recommended as the work schedule accounts for school schedules. The work place culture allowed me to network and meet people around the world with similar ambition. It  also allowed me the opportunity to improve on my communication and technical skill set and problem solving abilities. Fun place to work but it is easy to get over looked with the volume of employees that apple has. I worked for Apple doing both Tech support and AOS support and felt there was very little room for advancement as Apple generally has a very low turn over rate. My work was confidential and I do not wish to review my role, what I worked on, or what was expected of me during my time there. I appreciate Apple very much. I worked there for over 5 years during the Steve Jobs and Tim days and the company was and is great.  However you have to be willing to work hard and fast because no apple store is quiet and relaxing. As a sales specialist you are here to educate and provide the ultimate retail sales experience for the customers; you assist by putting products in the customers hands, finding out what their needs and passions are, what product is best suited for them. Apple was a good place for me to work while I was in college and in graduate school. Many people I worked with were actively perusing a career as a producer, actor, or photographer, so working at Apple kept them grounded as they reached for their dreams. The hours were pretty flexible, and the pay was fair. I did not have a great time at Apple, there were to many PhD's so everyone was right and could not agree on anything which only compounded the problem of operating in a silo with everything being so Top Secret it was not secret at all. Great infustructiure, excellent benifits, and a overall really postive enviournment, supportive collegues and managers I would suggest this company to anyone! Apple is certainly a great place to work.Even if you are working from home you are still connected  to the culture and expansiveness of the Apple culture Retail is retail and it might not where you want to be but starting at Apple Retail gave me great experience and access to tools other retails jobs might not have. Great place to work, fantastic benefits, fun culture if you love technology! I had a blast working there! I appreciated how they had you work on personal as well as professional goals simultaneously; it truly builds character. very unorganized: the culture is not what people on the outside.there was really no enjoyable part. it is a job for most people because they are in need of a job.From my past jobs i learned there is a way to communicate with your employees, Apple is not that way. Over stretched employees, fickle management follows rules when it suits them, trends towards blame game than work to find solution. Issues with favoritism from managers towards staff members. District and regional manager out of touch with the real concerns at the store level. Enjoyed learning the Apple products and processes.Enjoyed trading new advisors as they became a new team memeber of the Apple Care team.it was exciting to be able to look at processes and products and have a real ability to make amdifference Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. I loved this job can't wait to go back. Learned a lot it actually furthered my skills.i would highly suggest they will teach you skills that you can carry into the future I worked from home.  I found basically everything about Apple to be reputable and straight forward.  However the pay scale was too low for me to cover my monthly bills. I still work for Apple as an At Home Advisor.  The work can be tough and challenging, but the job is perfect for someone who can work from home. Working from home is not easy, as the only interaction you have with people is over the phone. great place to work. very enjoyable employee base and environment. good benefits, good benefits. loud customer base so dealing with ambiguity is huge I had a bad manager that spoiled the entire experience for me.  The guy did not care at all about me or how badly he screwed me over.  Nor did he have any sense of how to manage a team or properly rate individual performance.  The guy is completely clueless. The community at apple was fast paced and extremely nice.  I worked in back of house.  We were the grunt workers.  We kept track on all the products entering and exiting the building.  We participated in audits as well. The benefits are great, the management depends on location, CS skills a must. It is still a retail job, you deal with the life and struggles of a retail employee. My lasting memory of working at Apple will be the incredibly smart, talented, and hardest working individuals I've ever met. The best times were when there was no typical day at work. Things are always changing at Apple, including how they want to manage -- it can be tough. But the atmosphere is great. Very willing to work with you. You have to know a lot about the Mac operating system and have patience for those who do not.  You are kept busy the whole time and receive a mandatory, hour lunch break.  If you like to be busy and sell computers, this is the place for you. It was great working at apple. People are great, atmosphere nice, and food was great too. I don't know if this is going to help anyone's opinion, so I'll finish up here. Apple is a great place to work. If you are a student, they help you as much as they can. It is an incredible place to start your career. You learn something new everyday and get to meet great people along the way. Good Benefits, Culture is very positiveFrom a retail standpoint a lot of resiliency is needed, and advancement is tricky once you get set into a position, but otherwise the retail side is what you make of it. HBAs wake up at home, start a pot of coffee, brush their teeth, check the clock, and sit down at their desk. At home. No commute. No socializing. All work, but hey, you can walk your dog at lunch or catch up on Netflix. I learnt that working from home is not for me, a social animal with designs on learning and moving upwards in the firm. The opportunities are extremely limited, and once you agree to work from home, the chances you can return to campus are near nil. The hardest part of the job is to not go stir crazy with cabin fever. So, get out. Get a dog. Get a gym membership. Get used to the mundane daily customer contacts, and try to make each one special to the customer. Apple treats you as family instead of a employer. The schedule changes every 3 months, based on business needs and it’s a random pool for shifts. Overall great place to work for By far one of the best companies. Depending on the store of course, will depend your advancement as management will vary. But everyone is great for the most part, it’s a great job to start off with. Great experiences, great way of training you. Definitely not a place I would have ever stayed long term. Apples culture used to be much different.  It feels more and more like any other retailer now and any other big box store with assimilated employees that are there to blow smoke and butterflies infant of their customers in order to SELL.  There is always one more thing to push and mention and not forget to ask, all in an effort to generate more business and revenue.  Apples service model has changed from how can we help to how can we get you in and out as quickly as possible.  While Apple looks to appear an altruistic company to work for and does do some really great things for the community and is civil minded they still can not veil the fact that their actions are for pure profit and self sustainability.   I am certain that it is not like this in every Apple retail store and I can not speak for what the corporate culture is like but this overarching theme of disingenuousness permeates  the retail culture.• Hardest part of the job is dealing with the leadership teams.• They provide great benefits and stock options• Apple does have a decent model currently setup for self development and career path options. however it is used more and more for performance coaching.• Pay is competitive enjoyed my time there.  I wanted to go in a different direction and it wasn't available at the time.  I learned a great deal about Apple products and services.  Learned many qualities of providing great customer service. Apple was the greatest job ever. I had to make a decision between staying with Apple and moving or staying place. As a result, I had to take a leave of absence. That said - if I could go back - I would in a heart beat! Apple is definitely the pinnacle of retail. The managers are very supportive & the team is very dedicated to making you feel at ease. I would say that it can be draining from a mental stand point, but overall an awesome job & great career experience. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Work place was very relaxed but we did take lots of calls working here is a great place to get a push in the call center environment. it was in a great location as far as travel the managers were very cool for the most part, For the work that you are required to perform, many apple employees are very under paid. Management is so awesome, but sometimes the customers are very fierce. There is always a meeting in the opening of the store and closing. I was not fond of that. After I got off I just wanted to go home, but was not allowed to because there was always a meeting at closing time of the store even if every time was smooth with no problems. The organization doesn't know what its doing. It needed bodies so it hires and hires and then doesn't know what to do with the people it hires. We coach and try to help but then when it doesn't work out they try to push you out. The company just sees numbers not necessarily extenuating circumstances. The Apple store was one of the best places to work, as you got to be part of something big. The products are top notch, and the people are all very cool and fun. There is no pressure to be something you are not, and individuality is celebrated, not discouraged.The only real bummer is once you are in  a position, its very difficult to ascend up to higher positions. Management is often hired externally, and so becoming one from within is very rare. I truly believe that Apple would do better to search solely from within, thereby allowing people to grow and not feel stagnant. Other than that, its a wonderful place to work, and i would highly recommend it to anyone. At Apple, I was afforded the opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest people I have every met.  The expectations from management are sometimes impossible, but with the great team of people there we consistently performed what was previously thought to be impossible. Required to oversee R&D functions.  Required to drive up and down the east coast training various customers on how to sell and work the apple products. By far one of the best experience I've ever had working retail.  Everyone was friendly and eager to help each other out.  The C.O.R.E. training was very informative and detailed the core APPLE value. Great infrastructure and operations. Very well structured and operated. Easy to get used to and they have a great mind set. Workers a generally happy there. Good and productive use of time. Worked with other teams to fully understand the necessities of the project and utilize our tools and skills in the most effective manner. Great place to work in retail but corporate leaves some room to be desired. Lots of opportunities to eat for free and go to free events. Lots of smart colleagues and a free shuttle to work if you preferred to live in SF. Everyone was very welcoming and fun to work with.  It is a very laid back environment, but fast paced at the same time.  The work was fun and non stressful. I only did this job from home to be with my first born son the first year of his life. It has a lot of advantages , but it can be fairly stressful. I would recommend it for mothers or situations in the family such as this . Apple was a great company to work for. However, I ended up with a manager who had a grudge against me and specifically did what he could to keep me from advancing, although I had excellent Customer Satisfaction survey results. Contract position held under NDA. Good job but not many benefits being a contractor. Supervisors are great but have little interaction with their employees. Employees are held to different standards based on who they know/politics. A completely biased work environment. Only performance reviews I received were at my request, and still offered very little insight. Great pay for a retail job with TONS of opportunities to grow in all areas of your life.  Management was amazing when I was there-totally cared about everyone and sought to understand each of us and any challenges we may have had at or outside of work! It is really every good experience working for apple. I have ramping up to new technologies for immediate requirements.Co-ordination with client and team to deliver projects in timely manner. people love to backstab people constantly here. They also use alot of drugs just to cope with reality. Very few people ever advance without  sleeping with the manager and HR will fire you for reporting problems to them. Don't do it just don't. Great place to work no complaints learn a lot and grow quickly very relaxed diverse happy place you learn  a lot about the technology and new hot apps I got to see Steve Jobs at the cafeteriaA typical day at work:Meeting to see what needed to be done first.I've learned that Labview also runs on MacsWorkplace culture was good.The hardest part of the job was the commuteThe most enjoyable part of the job is that I treated my job as ifit was my own small company. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Stressful day to day, lack of communication and misleading management decision making. The staff members were the best portion of working in the culture. Apple gives you everything you need to pursue your project. Typically they are looking for people that will drive their own project, which is great for driven and passionate people, but stressful for those who would rather just go with a process. You will usually be responsible for whole projects and processes, which can be stressful, but makes you feel extremely important - because you are.Important thing to know is that every team at Apple has its own culture. The above comment seems to be the one unifying factor. Apple does a great job hiring the best people for the type of job it is. Great culture, genuine excited employees, huge opportunities to learn and grow I love everything about the company and the atmosphere.  Especially since I can work from home.  I suggest work hard if you are wanting to get promoted. Apple was a great place to work, worked in the customer service call center and we had a lot of fun employee activities and the management was supportive. It doesn't matter whether your manager thinks you're amazing and you're good. If you're hired as a contractor, you're expendable. If they don't have a headcount for you as full time, they will not fight for you, regardless of your contribution to your team and organization. Not the worst job I've ever had but not the best. Wish it wasn't so boring and so hard to move up. They create excitement and want you to focus on moving up but there aren't even any jobs open. There's literally 10,000 of us wanting a job that doesn't even exist great company to work for , excellent and level headed top mgmt. takes care of employees and invests in them for long term. overall good work life balance, i see a great future for them Apple is fund place to work with lot to learn and deliver.  It also has lot of expectation and work pressure and competitive environment.  It allows you to help learn and perform. Apple doesn't seem to hire people over the age of 45, no matter how perfect attendance or quality of work. I've nothing else to add about the company. When I did my interview vs working there It was totally different. If you have confidence and are good at your job it's very competitive and not that comfy of a work environment. best job i have had yet so far, apple really cares about their employees, if you want to work in an environment where you grow, lots of teamwork, you will like working for apple call center too controlling and demanding call centers tend to want to know your every move from breaks to lunch. They know when you are not at your computer and will have your supervisor come look for you if you are away from your desk. And your commission is based on surveys which is not fair. Customer's can be angry with the company but reps pay the consequence and receive a bad survey not fair either. Apple is an awesome company to work for but it can depend on the department. Those following Apple's culture are amazing, those that are more from acquisitions haven't fully embraced the culture. Overall the company is pushing to make a great experience for it's customers and isn't worried about whether or not X feature will sell more iPhones. It's all about making it better for the consumer. If you're looking to get in somewhere and make close to 50k per year with no experience within a year and a half of working, this is your place. But, if you're experienced you better be ready to be fighting entry level people for the positions that you're more qualified for. If not, they will absolutely place an entry level person in a position over a skilled employee. It's all about who you know. Preparing Phones and working hardfast paced environment fix a iphone diverse and welcomingSetting a goal eachdayEveryone interacting with everyone all very depend on project where you are, if you in good team you can learn a lot and grow fast, in some teams  you will have a lot of manual works. in general ok Great Place, Great People, Lots of training, Lots of overtime available if u want to make some extra money. Have to go through a temp agency. They Have 1 year contracts. It isn't what you would think it would be unless you are thinking of a nice box with a mess inside. It is hit or miss depending on department. Management is hit or miss when it's good it's great, when it is horrible it is worse than you can imagine. Lazy. Entitled. Unskilled. Unprofessional. Success is hampered by top heavy and often management debacles. some teams are good and some teams are not good. It depends on whom you encounter.  In one team I worked, the people are not competent and there are lots of politics. In another team I worked, engineers are generally good, but the managers are not honest. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Great place to work for students who are still in college. They have great perks for all of their workers specially students. They have education programs where they will pay a portion of your tuition. Great job to get through school. The culture is great, management could use some work and the pay could be better considering the company is one of the wealthiest, but loved it beyond that. Professional Training is providedOne on one coaching is adhered toGreat benefits including an on-site medical clinicI really enjoyed working at Apple. The only negative thing I experienced was amount of phone time allowed to resolve issues with a customer. If you are looking for an incredible environment that builds skills, encourages feedback, and supports growth and development...this is the place for you! Job itself is great, however still retail hours which are all over the place. No consistency. Apple Suburban square. My immediate manager was great however management overall wasn't that great. Quick burnout and employees didn't seem supported. Favoritism seemed to happened when promotions happened. Interesting environment. Yet still one of the best retail experiences and that was mostly due to the people. Definitely a great place to work. Great benefits and amazing people. A place for growth and lots to learn. I would definitely recommend to anyone interested to apply. Come and work with the best.  This is not place to have fun, it is a place to do you best work and push hard.  The company is large enough that there are varying sub-cultures, so it is important to learn about each team and how it operates. Great Place to work. Very fast paced and a lot of room for movement within the company. You'll gain valuable experience with apple in customer service and things that you'll find yourself using outside of work. Apple was a great place to work, my coworkers were helpful and knowledgeable. The environment was collaborative and I thoroughly enjoyed my work, but I decided to transition to a different industry. This was an amazing job! Super fun and easy to get the hang of. It seems like a lot to take in but once the flow of calls is Completely handled then the job role just gets easier. Your experience working for Apple retail will directly relate to the store you work at. For example my store is always busy and all of my coworkers work hard which makes it less stressful. Employees at other stores that are less busy are typically lazier and less fun to be around. One thing that Apple is big on is GREAT Customer Service skills. The sales people are encouraged to go over and above their duties to establish good rapport with the customers. Management at the retail level is all about meeting the bonus they receive, they don't support the internal team or back them when it comes to dealing with difficult customers.  Might not be the case for all locations, but seems to be the 'new culture' at most apple stores I am familiar with. Very well rounded place to work. Flexible hours of operation, as well as a good environment to be in as well. Learned a lot about software and how to deal with the troubles of customers,and problem solving also. Very professional. During my time at Apple, I had been introduced to a second family. The company is amazing when it comes to teaching and trying to better their employees. Whether you're in college looking for work or looking for a career in that field. I would always recommend Apple. I worked as an AHA.  There's not a ton of advancement available if you don't live where they have an actual office building, but you can move from t1 to t2, from that to management etc. It's fine and their benefits for healthcare were the best i've ever had. Apple was an amazing company full of experiences and learning opportunities. Most companies will state they offer room for growth, but do not; however, Apple offers plenty of opportunity for training and growth within the company. If you desire a position and prove that you are exceeding expectations in your current role, they will notice your hard work and offer you the guidance you need to move up. Apple is wonderful with work life balance. You are not allowed to complete any work related duties off campus/off clock. You cannot check your emails or prepare/study for tests/training. They are adamant about breaks and lunches as well. Apple as a company that appreciates hard work when they see it and lazy workers do not get by, if they even make it through the Apple interviews! Apple is a amazing place to work and a company that really takes care of their employees and makes sure they’re very comfortable. It’s almost so good your get too comfortable and stuck in relax mode. nice company to work. good exposure to latest technology. nice oppurtunity for data engineers as they get to work on latest hadoop technologies like hive, spark  etc it is overall good job fo the person who does not have any certificate and experience. It only ask you to be on time and follow their rules and regulation. If you can do that, then you will be fine. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Good environment, very competitive, cafe is delicious and so is the smoothie bar. Management is very engaging throughout their busy schedules, you will meet your superior at least one time. Most of the time you're on the phone facing customers and have to help them with whatever issue they are having. You're in customer service so you often have to deal with bad attitudes and a strict policy of conduct with little room for failure. I worked for the company a long time ago and the experience was not at all what i expected. The room for advancement was very slow to move forward. The location and environment were of a very poor quality. I was given promises for time off and was still reprimanded. My wife had our second child and i was soon fired after taking 4 days off the company felt this was a violation to the attendance policy and i was terminated and advised not to return to the location. It's a place of divers culture and a person is allowed to just be themselves with out fear of judgement or complaints . Apple is a great place to work Benefits are great, but this is not the job for someone who is in school or has a family. Many people stay for years because they are comfortable and because it is a great mall job especially when you do not have a degree. Apple is a great working place. There is a lot of opportunities, especially for the fast-growing demands on software engineering. People at Apple are talented. You always learn a lot from your colleagues and managers! It's hard to rate a tech giant. Culture differs heavily from org to org and no two employees will have the same experience. However, I will say the overall culture is that Apple cares heavily about their brand and products. However, this kind of dedication and focus does not translate the same with how they treat employees. While they provide more than the average company, they are not as focused as other tech giants in making sure all employees are treated the same. Everyday was pretty unique in its own way. Never really had the same issue, and if it was, it was easy to fix and quick.You get trained on the Apple devices and how to fix them with a few simple steps. But if it required Hardware fixes, you had to assist with setting up appointments.The management there was great, they always worked with you, never really dogged you down for lack of experience or how long you took to resolve an issue. They just wanted the job done and that's how it was all around. No call times, just getting the job done.The hardest part of the job would probably be the calls you get that would last about 1 hour or even longer. I've had a call that had lasted about 3 hours because I was assisting in resetting more than one device. But since there is no call/handle time. I got my job done. Not going into detail, but a proud company, that has it's ups and downs. Most if not all days are hectic as it is a still a retail job but it does have its cooperate benefits. I Love Apple and Apple products. Learning environment, dealing with a talented crowd. Productive meetings and great trainings. Leaders are real leaders. Working at Apple is a truly great experience, working there you are placed in an atmosphere where they want you to develop and become a strong team member. Always encouraging you to be great. I like my previous work with apple warehouse.was my first opportunity to work in USA, so i grasp a lot of experience  while working as a technician and quality analysis. Nice working condition and environment.The schedule is not intense.You are going to meet different people in the cafeteria and you can talk to them.I have good Apple desktop and monitor equipped when I was working there. Actually, everyone has one. That is nice. This pace not only trains you to work in such environment but it also gives you the best life school, how to talk to people and how to take your actions responsibly. After this job, you can go only higher, but it's pretty hard to find the same benefits as the ones that Apple offered. Lots of pros.  Only a few cons.Pros would include:- when you're off the clock, you are off the clock- great training- company discounts- promotions can come quick- lots of free Apple swagCons:- You had to bid for your schedule every few months.- Every schedule included a full Saturday or Sunday- Management would use my matrix scores to get themselves promotions (happened 3 times).It was only when I put in my 2 week notice that they offered me a promotion to senior advisor.  I had already accepted a new job by then. Everyone is amazing, the culture is great. It is an amazing place to work, and a great place to grow as an individual and to grow with a team. I would recommend. people are always being moved around in apple care... its not uncommon to have multiple managers, and job titles without  requesting it. In one year I was moved to 3 different departments, and had 5 managers. Apple Care employees are attempting to keep up with all the new at Apple. Its pure madness. Helped many customer with a variety of issues from account log in problems, downloading issues, refunds, and iPhone, iPad and devices as well, worked from home but miss the office Astonishing focus on silos even within functional business units.  Cross-team collaboration limited to the network of relationships that you develop yourself.  Unlimited supply of middle-management resources.  The company can afford extensive duplication of effort and never misses an opportunity to exercise that preference.  Apple's core capabilities are world-class consumer device design coupled with great supply chain management.  Yes, the supply chain management piece is outsourced. I loved the people I worked with! My managers always had my best interest in mind. Career advancement is a possibility and changing rolls once hired is not hard to do, as long as there is the position available. Working with customers can make or break your day. For busy season or special holidays where you have to work, food is usually provided. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Is an amazing company to work for they have a lot of Cora values that you could learn and use in your every day to day life as well as your work life is great to have a work life balance the people are there to provide service to customers and learn at the same time on top of you getting the stock and working for the number one company in the USA It was a telecommute through a vpn. Typically it was a very relaxed job. You get up and log into the iMac they send you to use and get calls via a dedicated phone line.  Calls are tech support issues. Hardest part is to be able to resolve issues without somebody to bounce the issue off of. All in all a pretty awesome job. we are working in apple to check the mobile and the dignostics of these devises and also check physically damages and then we pass the units or fail it according to the fail codes. Assist customers and come up with viable solutions to their issues whether software or hardware related. Learned the core Apple values to provide the best Apple experience, learned how to communicate and be empathetic with various types of customers, and learn how to communicate and support your teammates and the overall team. The management does tend to micromanage at times, which plays as an obstacle for the overall Apple experience for the customers that we serve. The workplace culture is quite welcoming as the team welcomes everyone with open arms and an open mind. The hardest part of the job is when a viable solution can not be determined or the customer, or when a customer does not agree with the solutions that are provided for them with their best interests. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding the perfect solution(s) for the customer and having them not only look at you as their technician, but as a trustworthy friend, and they leave with a huge smile on their face. was a very good job enjoyed to learn different pros  and cons about the company but the overall experience was great and I really really did learn a lot from the company Very diverse and filled with opportunity of development. Apple is viewed as a high demanding  environment. Apple offers creativity for their employees and customers. It is the new gathering place! Easy and fun. The work day is really simple. Basic call center position. One hour lunches and two thirty minute breaks. Managers are helpful and want to see you succeed. They provide excellent training , the opportunity to work from home, career advancements and open communication with management.  Great benefits and updated devices to work with. great place to work if you are young and tech savvy. the management is easy to work with and deeply care about your time and effort at Apple. its very fun to work at such an innovative company. work life/home life was poormanagers were not on the same page as far as following procedures.great benefitslots of training/testingrewards for performance are Nice . Apple has a great culture and environment to learn, and grow, for yourself and for customer.  It can be very fulfilling introducing someone to technology for the first time,  either for themselves,  their family and friends, or even their business.  As much as it is fun to train, learn, and experience the technology ,  introducing new users for the first time. But with Apple a popular destination, the retail store can be very demanding and stressful.  It is with strong passion and empathy can you get through it for yourself, the customer, and the company. A lovely workplace with great benefits. The job can be a little stressful, but it makes up for it in good employee culture. I would recommend this job to someone that is interested in quick advancement! Loved working for Apple, but finally decided working from home wasnt for me. If there were at the time other options to apply for after my move, I would still be with the company. Apple has been an excellent working environment. I've learned and grown both personally and professionally. Cross functional collaboration is executed well and the teams all work towards the same mission. The At Home Advisor position is relaxed at least until the phone starts ringing. I learned a ton.Management was excellent. Workplace culture was excellent given that it as at home. Hardest part of the job id angry customersThe most enjoyable part of the job is resolving customer's technical issues. I loved working for people and helping them resolve technical issues. Rolling out the bed and into work is the most exciting thing possible. Also making someone else's day light up by resolving a simple tech issue. I recommend working for Apple. The education division is a good place to start. I felt like I was making a difference for students in K12 and HiEd. Products are second to none. I appreciated my time at Apple. It was an amazing job to work at while going to school. I grew in many ways and it taught me to think critically, to take ownership of my career, and to deal with any type of experience that would come my way. I would say, however, that I did not find advancing in the company easy nor, at times, welcomed. I felt there was an encouragement to grow, but stay in your lane at the same time. Having said that, the benefits and company culture was amazing and I loved my co-workers. Apple taught me about what it was like to be apart of something great and work for a company that that is ahead of all others in innovation. It taught me the power of feedback and how to be better about receiving that. I was a Mac Genius, my job was to help people with their Macs if they ever had any harI have never worked for company that has invested in its people so much. 10/10 would recommend. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Retail job. So dealing with the general public everyday was draining. Learned a lot of tangible and soft skills. Management can be overbearing and you can get stuck in one role for a long time. But overall, I would recommend. They use the shot gun approach to hiring and projects always hoping to land a winner. No employee development.Zero structure in any department. Not a fun place to work For the most part, Apple Retail is a great place to work. As with any job, you only get out what you put into it. I formed many great friendships and learned a great deal of customer service skills while there. Apple computer refurbishing distribution center is a fast pace business alot of problem solving and customer relations issues addressed due to water house accessibility and convince. I recommend that anyone seeking full-time ware house work should consider and apply for a position it was an excellent experience. Majority of the people have positive attitudes and we all work well together, even the leads and trainers too. Work is easy, fast and well explained.. Great company, management is ok, overall a great culture. Very nice office environment and flexible work from home in some positions. Great product discounts. Really good job for development. I enjoy working with my peers and its great for individuals that are going to school because they can be flexible with your hours. Non-stop engagement with internal and external customers. Learning atmosphere. Get to know people on a daily basis. Toughest part is to get team members to acknowledge customers and prioritize work from internal personal conversations. Most enjoyable is ability to get to know people and further develop as a person. Highly technically volatile organization. Enjoyed working in this organization. Priorities changes on a daily basis. Customer centric and focussed more towards customer satisfaction. I loved working for Apple. I found that they helped drive personal development, good communication within the team, and a bit of healthy competition. It was a really fun environment. You work with customers throughout the day - many of which don't understand the products very well or are pretty frustrated. The most important thing is that you enjoy relating to people, helping them find solutions, making technology relatable for them and assisting their understanding of their issues. The role involves a lot of patience and a great attitude. I loved the team and the behind the scenes culture. I made a lot of great friends working there who I'm still in touch with years after being in the role. The best part about the job is the people and the brand. Apple is an amazing brand and no matter where in the world I travel to I now feel at home at the Apple  retail store. Working for Apple as a retail Specialist is a stressful but fulfilling job so long as you value connecting with people and building relationships while you earn your paycheck.  The company has tides of ultra-corporate and a pseudo 'mom and pop' feel, which can be frustrating to navigate without prior experience.  Definitely the most intellectual workplace I've been involved in, and I'd possibly return, however people quit their management, not the job, so the likelihood is low. The schedules are not flexible, the calls are jam packed all day and all night. But you make good money and have great benefits. I worked from home so that was cool Apple is the sole of a great company. The employees work together to better the products and personnel.  I would never give up the 4 1/2 years of amazing team building, educational periods and customer interaction.  Apple made me understand what a top notch company should be. To be welcomed back by just calling will always be my greatest accomplishment. My team members are wonderful. But there is just no support and lack of communication with the leadership team.  Amazing benefits though. I have fun often but there just isn't enough pay and support. loved working here. best work environment. passion for their internal and external customers. they offered the best benefits of all the employers I've ever worked for. Amazing job! The coworkers were all very creative. Managers were very easy to get along with. Theres a code of providing fearless feedback which I love and should be added to all companies! It was very hard to get ahold of. I left messages, they were returned more than a week later. Just was not an ideal situation. I was put in job position that i was not trained for. Great work place, My managers were extremely fun and sometimes allowed me to take hour lunches if necessary. Wasn't a complicated process to ask for overtime, I can just text my manager and ask to come in. Sometimes overtime was mandatory if a new iphone or iphone software was coming out. It's easy to rack up paid time off, especially if you enjoyed doing overtime and is always at work Coworkers are awesome. you'll make great friends with everyone. always ask your coworkers for help instead of the managers, they will always be willing to help and advise on any situation. Apple is a great company to work for. They help you learn how to do your job in the most effective manner possible. Your goal is to offer the best customer service possible. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Apple is an amazing company to work for but the atmosphere is beyond exhausting. I became such an introvert after working here for almost 4 years. I wish it was more fair when it came to having weekends off without needing to request them. Amazing job worked there for almost two years and miss them everyday of course all good things come to an end but i enjoyed the time i have with them. They provide decent jobs, yet you have to stay on them to produce different job oppurtunities.The job I obtained through them was very short lived. Overall it has fulfilled its purpose as a staffing agency.  Although, I went through the motions to get my W-2 forms to file my taxes this year. And still have not received them.I had to go forward without filing them. didn't like management or pay scale. both were very confusing to understand which is why no one understood what they were going to be paid at payday. Ironic I always joke that Apple is like the church, they may be part of the same umbrella, but each location is drastically different. My first experience at an Apple Store was very difficult, fraught with scrutiny, unrealistic expectations, and gossip culture. My second store was much more close knit and friendly, but significantly less results driven It was good as a job but I felt no career advancement here. I wasn't paid nearly enough for the cost of living. The stock options are nice but the take out taxes because of them. Great Culture, great people. You have to really ooze corporate culture. With that said, I did enjoy my time at Apple and would highly recommend to someone looking to spend some time working there. A good place to work, and get a promotion, lots of benefits, and a good place to grow, I would recommend this company to anyone who want to go place and improve their skills Apple Retail is a great company to work. You have multiple opportunities for growth and you learn a lot about a number of areas. It is fun to work and interact with people from all different cultures and backgrounds. Upward mobility is a bit tough/convoluted due to the nature of retail. So if you are in for the long haul it's great, but don't expect to are to get promoted relatively quickly. Overall, Apple is a great company to work for and I would recommend it to anyone willing to learn and work hard. Not your typical workplace. We are a diverse and unique environment with much more to provide then a 9-5 job. There are many opportunities and advances among the company which depends on your desire to achieve such a thing. Apple has a fast-paced but rewarding and supportive work environment. I enjoyed working there and being able to assist customers with their technological problems. Its a place where everyone helps each other to grow in the area they are working in. Management was really helpful as well always there to guide you and give you tips to do better. I learned a lot while working for apple. I was extensively cross-trained on nearly every service Apple offers and eventually became a Senior Advisor. The training was good and very thorough. The benefits were great and management was very knowledgable. Employees seemed to have positive attitudes and worked well together as a team.The hardest part of the job was working two chats at the same time to resolve two separate customers very different issues. The best part of the job was being able to work from home and see my kids so much. It is a great company in business. However it is not the company that values employees like they claimed.  Pros1. teammates are nice2. great to start as an entry level positioncons1. zero life-work balance: they treat you like a robot instead of human being.2. bureaucracy 3. low efficiency on business decision ( one decision can last 7 years to be made)4. low chance of promotion5. few study or training due to lack of business need6. not so competitive benefits 7. Lack of transparency Good management and culture. Give and receive feedback well. They look for and advance employees that are thinkers and action oriented innovators. They make it hard to leave. There is always the good and the bad about every place, but apple has a veery supportive culture, great stock and benifits.................................. Enjoyed being surrounded by the creative type however, the clientele at this particular location (Century City, CA) are very demanding and make the job more stressful. I was actually advanced in different hiring processes because of my proven past and effort. I helped with Today at Apple art sessions and also with Summer Camp. Usually, you must wait six months before consideration of advancement. I was interviewed to be a teacher in the creative department to lead more Today at Apple events. I had to leave due to it being part time but loved the job. Advancement is possible but it requires some serious networking. Promoting from within doesn't happen that much unless you consider lateral movements an advancement. Its Apple good job good benefits. I was there for 6 months i had to relocate . Miss the Managers and support staff. i would recommend to anyone  willing to take on responsibilities and tough work Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. The work at Apple is generally very repetitive, though this is to be expected. The work place environment is very friendly and the people who work there are very nice and respectful. Unfortunately the organization and leadership were often lacking and we rarely had any idea what was going on above us and worst of all management didn't really care about any input from lower level workers, who are, after all, the one's using the systems and software and following and implementing the procedures and policies. Generally a somewhat disorganized and frustrating place to work, albeit still again a very pleasant and not overly stressed day to day work environment. The pay and benefits were not very impressive either and they didn't seem very interested in helping you advance or continue to work for Apple. it was overall a job that i meant to join and leave                                                    apple game me benefits and i made friends there who i still talk to but i like to do jobs temperately and then do something else because i love to try new things. I worked from home for Apple. I did enjoy my time there. There was plenty of training as needed. Managers were always there for support. Wages were comparable to other companies. lots of things to do never a dull moments stays busy, co workers are involved routinely on every day of work and duties on and off the floor , exciting I left Apple almost a year ago for another opportunity. I can still say that they strive to live by the motto 'best place to work'.The company culture is one that allows for change to accommodate everyone. Also don't show any kind of negative emotion ever. Seen people let go for short burst of frustration or anger over something very reasonable. Don't count on the job for a long term thing. Overall, the Apple store is a fun and great place to work that is fast-paced and competitive. The team and the culture are what makes Apple what it is and it makes going to work something to look forward to. I loved working at Apple. It was a great team of people and the projects were challenging and innovative. It was the highlight of my career, I enjoyed the culture and was proud of the work. They are a good company but the leadership in my store was poor I was in several locations and trust me they are all different  so good some poor but over all it was an experience I’m glad a took Even though apple doesn't pay well, the management was really good and the Team work was Awesome. I've never had he opportunity to work with a really good team like I had with them. We still keep in touch. You feel that you're making a difference. The work is challenging and never stops. There are many smart people all around and a lot of teamwork. Benefits are awesome and fun beer bashes. I worked at 4 different Apple Stores over three years and had a wonderful experience at each one. The jobs pay well, the environment is healthy, and there is plenty of paid time off. There are great benefits and the people that you will meet here are amazing. Best job I've had. Always great people that work here. The job is tough but fast-paced and you learn important skills like conflict management and interpersonal communication. not a carrer job. you have to work odd hours. best way in retail. very competitive. good benefits. no work life balance. good starting job. not a career job. can feel like a cult As a Technician, my every day job was to assist customers on mobile and mac issues at the genius bar. The environment is very stressful as you're dealing with mostly angry customers with little faith in their products. Apple corporate also is not open at all to its Genius bar employees on certain issues so you can be stuck trying to convince your customer to have faith in their product regardless of the issue. The role isn't very technical at all and does not require too much TECHNICAL skill. In fact, many people I worked with were completely blind to the way hardware and software actually worked. You don't need any formal education (degrees, certification) to be a genius as you learn most things from working day by day. The pay is significantly lower than other technical roles in the market mainly because of the fact that you do not need to know anything technical like (Networking, Unix Systems, etc.) For retail, the pay is great.Management is very political and the culture is VERY liberal. You must think and be like them to be favored and potentially move up. Going to corporate is almost impossible since most technical corporate jobs require real world technical experience and knowledge. The genius bar just isn't enough and is more of a customer service job than anything. Apple retail is okay for a retail job. Very chaotic and the managers are probably overworked but the people you work with are great for the most part. The pay isn't great so jobs there don't really work out well for those with families or those who live in expensive areas. The benefits are pretty good for retail though. I worked at Apple a long time ago, when I first moved over to California. Work place was fun and productive, it provided a good learning experience. I would gladly go back to Apple if given the opportunity. Apple was a great company to work for. Met a lot of amazing people there and the benefits were amazing. Only thing is, they claim to want to help you move up and have better opportunities at Apple, but they make it near impossible for you to do so unless you suck-up to the right people. Well this was applicable to the specific store I worked for. 90% of the calls that come in are from customers who have a problem and they are frustrated with the product and looking for someone to blame.After a while is becomes too mentally draining. Excellent benefits, stock options, flexible working hours, plenty of overtime. Paid holidays and sick leave. A good work environment. Clean and safe facilities. Paid tuition for education. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. I learned so much about the product, and the staff are some of the best people I ever met. The discount was amazing, and I met interesting customers there daily. If you are passionate about Apple products and tech in general, this is the place for you! Growth and knowledge within the field is encouraged, and you get to talk tech all day! Great place to work but retail hours are tough and the pay was low for non management.Wonderful culture, great benefits and supportive work environment. I enjoyed working at their Data Center though it was brief due to my contract being cut short because I was offered a position that paid more and I couldn't turn it down. If you are running a store, expect calls at all hours. There is not a lot of opportunity for advancement above store leaders. They recently eliminated a lot of field positions and are extending the stretch of Market Leaders to have bigger territories. I enjoyed working for apple support through a third party company. I was any to get unlimited over time where i worked about 20 extra hours overtime. I was then laid off due to apple not needing much people to work. I felt as if i was laid off due to taking so many hours in over time each week. Great family environment but a very stressful job with a lot of requirements for career advancement. Very customer focused with a do whatever will make the customer happy attitude. Apple taught me about what is was like to be apart of a team and work for a company that strived for results. It taught me the power of feedback and how to be better about receiving that. Apple makes great products. Some managers are awful some are great. If you work really hard, you will be rewarded. You cannot expect to be hired and jump in with suggestions - get in, learn your job, do it really well and once you are trustworthy you can start to share your ideas. • Everyday is the same thing unless other lines need help. • I learned that everybody has to work together to make it work.• The hardest part of the job is packing because everything has to be perfect and brand new.• The most enjoyable part of the job is learning lots of different stations and you get to pick where you want to do. Apple until today is still possibly my favorite job I have ever had. The creative minds that I am able to surround myself with, the social environment, the constant streams of communication with co-workers and managers with feedback and relationship building all spoke to who I was as a person and allowed me to thrive in an environment where you are required to constantly be on your toes and to think critically about problem solving. focus on personal growth and great management. Truly enjoyed working here thus far.  It is a retail environment unlike any other. They are flexible and meet you where you are at. Productive, fun, and great place to work and advance with lasting friendships. Highly recommend it. Wish they paid a bit more, but otherwise a great place and would easily recommend. Typical day there is badging in, going to your section within the warehouse your supposed to be in and simply sit at your station waiting for a device to come down the conveyor belt. typical day it work is busy and loud.learned to handle ambiguity.management pushes me to grow.feel empowered to help people.communicating with customers can be challenging.every co-worker wants you to succeed. Loved working with my team and the entire work experience. There was always an opportunity to learn and advance and I really would have stayed for 20 years had I not started a family. I actually was employed through Kelly Services and not Apple so this my be a bit misleading.  However, I did the same job (AppleCare Technical Support Representative) that Apple direct employees did.  I worked from home with a great deal of freedom and I enjoyed the job, helping customers and troubleshooting issues. Apple is a good company to work for i have worked there for nearly five years about 15 years ago,management is very friendly and everybody can progress internally, Apple HR are very good Lots of great colleagues, but pressure to outperform yourself every month gets tiring. Compensation is very good, but expect to spend more than 50 hours per week to do your job. There is a constant pressure to do more and more (expand responsibility), don't expect to be focusing on the core skills that got you hired. Stand up position for hoursPlenty of overtimePeople were amazing to work withReal demanding positionsManagement was always there to assistGood position for warehouse experience Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Customers don't call tech support until they are very angry.Dealing with angry uncooperative people was very stressful. Thats not Apples fault. Thats just the nature of the phone support business. Worked as a contractor at Apple, Inc. Typical workflow is stable, if somewhat repetitive. Management generally responds quickly to any questions and concerns. apple warehouse was a pretty decent job I learned how to work the assembly Line package and send of phone also try to package up as many phones as i can by the end of the day but i would say the enjoyable part was cleaning up my station area. your day involves talking to customers who usually have no idea how to use their phones. You are timed and measured on every single thing you do. There is no script but you have multiple things that you must say on every call it was my first job in US. it was a pretty good experience and learned new skills. got a chance to work with different people at a same time.Good management team. Apple is a great place. Everybody wants to help people and it shows. Everybody cares about everybody else succeeding and is always open for questions. The pay is great for retail work and the work/life balance is wonderful. The schedule can be a pain, but it's hard to have a good schedule in the retail world. it was a seasonal position but I tried to get full time and the managers was about putting her goals before helping me get a full time position. I wish it was longer Really over estimated what technicians were allowed to do or learn at the retail level. There are people in high school more capable than some of the repair technicians at apple retail. However, Apple designs their repair strategy around obedient employees, not smart, free thinking technicians. When obvious product defect trends arise, Apple will give their employees no information on the issue forcing them to play dumb to their out-of-warranty clients. Eventually, the company will offer limited services programs often only when faced with class action suits. This experience diluted my opinion of the company and lead to a lot of personal misery while working a second part time job to improve my quality of life.Shortly after I left: New hires with less education and experience getting offered more money starting that many current employees.decent benefits options for part timers The company is overall great especially for part time employees. There is opportunities to advance but does require a great amount of focus and overall excessive working hours. was a really cool experience wish i had more time to spend age that job but the opportunity for advancement too 40 hr work week wasn't very possible and the management was something else Great place to work.  Many perks.  I really enjoyed working for this company.  Depends what department you are working for, some departments could be laid back while few might have to meet certain deadlines.  Overall, this company was fun, relaxing, enjoyable & generous with your pay & benefits. I didn’t really enjoy the overall experience of working at Apple. The hours were untimely and usually later into the night almost morning and the pay was small for the call volume and knowledge they would like us to know. Working for Apple was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had as far as career choices, If i had the opportunity I'd do it again.Apple prepared me for tech related job advancement. I would recommend Apple, Inc. to anyone interested in technology as a career. They are very structured and care about your growth. The customer service is top notch. They care about the sale both before and after the purchase. One of the best companies that I've worked for. Culture is excellent and everyone is looking out for each other. other than that it is typical, probably more busy of a retail location. There is some freedom with things like scheduling and breaks, but the pay is not great, there’s very few transferable skills to take home, the benefits are almost non-existent, and there are almost no opportunities to advance. Apple is a great company to work for. Their values are amazing, they genuinely love to help people and just have a good time all the time. I would recommend applying for this place. had a very serious stalking situation and worked as an executive for 8 years. Instead of helping, my very new manager had a panic attack and reported my concern, If you're interested in combining a passion for customer service and technology, Apple Retail is the place to hone your skills.The things you'll learn at a store will stay with you throughout any career path you take. I LOVE Apple as a company. You will not find a better company to work for. The benefits are amazing, hands down. FMLA, paid vacation and sick time, discounts on Apple and non-Apple products, reimbursement for internet and gym memberships and college education, the list goes on and on. Working for the company for 3 years, I am trusted with my lack of opportunities to move to another position in the company. When first hired, it was preached that we wouldn't be in a position for too long if we are good workers and that if we want to be somewhere, we will get there. I spoke with managers who had only worked for Apple for 3 years. Now I am there but I feel stuck. This may be due to the major hiring spree I was hired into, but it also just feels like there aren't as many opportunities as we were told. I would never speak bad about this company, like I mentioned, best company ever. But I dislike my current position and I feel stuck. Also working from home and living at home can get tiring. I miss the outside world. Apple offers in store experiences to get you out of the house, but I don't live near a store or service provider so, again, I feel stuck. Hence, why I am on Indeed. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Great company cares about their employees. I worked in the At home advisor position for a year. The test to get in was very difficult but worth it. Your manager actually cares about what you want to do at apple or beyond. Great experience I would love to work for the company again. They gave overtime every week and it was greatly appreciated. It was a work from home job. grat place to work and pay is excellent for someone who is in their 20's and just starting out without a mortgage or are looking for a second part time job. Culture was good, discounts were great. Retail on a holiday or launch day was always nuts. Managment on a store level was prone to mostly petty kids however who played favorites. I enjoyed my contract position at Apple because it gave me the opportunity to advance my technical skills as well as my communication skills. It allowed me to gauge my skills and see what is required in the video conferencing field and working with Cisco products. Apple was a good company to expand my knowledge of repairs and business practices but the corporate side is what was lacking as far as the human element is concerned Apple culture is very fast-paced environment, you can learn every day new subjects, very friendly management, enjoyable part is variability and the hardest part is excellent achievement for reaching goal. Enjoyed working for Apple, management and team were great to work with. There's tons of training available to ensure you're knowledgeable. Management was flexible with working hours and time off. You will work long hours and others will steal credit for your accomplishments. I would never advise anyone to work for apple unless you care more about 'Working at apple' than living a decent life. Wonderful Company with mostly non judgmental people. Plenty of opportunities for the right people. Will train the right person for any position, they look for people persons. I received projects which allowed me to explore other fields in design. I was able to learn new softwares in order to produce designs associated with Ui/UX and got to work with other teams on projects Apple is a great company to work for. I enjoy helping customers. To resolve issues you must focus and follow articles. Apple provides the tools necessary to win! Its a hard labor job that was interesting into learning better and more of work. The enivorments that varity of locations where good areas and where suitable. come in and get ready to take over work station,i learned how to become a team leader and train new employees,Management was always on task,Work place was very professional, fun friendly environmentthe hardest part about this job was always staying on task and or multitasking for long period of hours.What i enjoyed most about this job was that it challenged my multitasking skills and prepared me for any kind of fast working environment. They waste your time doing countless interviews, and post full time, only to  hire part time  so if your at least 18 and don't want a full time your good. Most days were spent helping Apple customers with their devices or account services. Not only did I learn about Apple's products, but also a fantastic way to assist people and help people resolve problems, whether Apple related or not. The management is great, and you can tell they're trained to be relaxed and forgiving, not overlording, which allows people to flourish rather than feel like a machine cog. The workplace culture was amazing. The hardest part was dealing with issues people had which didn't seem to have a resolution, as I very much dislike not being able to reach a resolution or agreement with the customer. However, the best part was, of course, resolving those issues, as well as being able to work from the comfort of my own home, which isn't anywhere near an Apple facility. Apple was great. what can I say. I worked at the Soho store at a vary exciting time it the companies history. I started before the iphone and left right after Jobs Campus Rep in school. Provided great perks and a very accommodating schedule. Work coincides with marketing, business, and retail. You also get hands-on learning by visiting campus HQ I worked for apple and it got me through college with good pay! They do provide ways to grow but you own that development. Most days are hectic but it helps to learn how to work under pressure. Best environment to work. an incredible professionalism that really motivates to go in every single day, meeting and working with people from different background. It's just amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed my time while employed with Apple.  I had awesome management and the work life balance was awesome!  The benefits were the best I'd ever had of any company I'd work for in my 20+ year career. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. Apple is a great company to develop, learn, create and innovate. The management can be at times very micromanage. Overall you will have a more positive experience than a negative one. No work / life balanceHorrible  managementStressfull Managers are disconnected and rude customers are entitled and abrasiveupper management are only about numbers It's a busy but fun place to be. Everybody is very friendly, willing to educate, very patient with new employees and questions. The customers can be a little ridiculous but for the most part it's fun just to see new technology. Apple provides a ton growth opportunities for employees at all levels. Definitely one of the best places to work. The hours can be challenging for some, but overall Apple is hard to beat. Great benefits, fantastic culture. A typical day at work you will meet a lot of people, and if you are in the family room it's not always happy people, but you have the tools at your disposal to turn frowns upside down. You can learn a lot from Apple, but the best tools for your life you will get from the first week or two going through training. They are steps that you will use everywhere, in every relationship, and they just make life better. The culture of Apple is apparent in everything you do with your co-workers, and if you get negative, remember everybody has those days, and that everybody is trying to advance too. Don't let negative feelings get in the way of your progression. Management cares about everybody even if they don't always show it, they are just super busy too with all the operations they have to take care of. They are running the store, while taking care of all the areas that need help, cut them a little slack if they don't always pay 100% attention to you. The hardest part of the job is you may not have a life outside of work, because people expect Apple employees to be superheros and make everything better, you may spend more time on the clock than initially intended, but Apple does everything to make sure you are still getting the best balance you can. Best and worst part pt. II, Holidays, tons of free food in the break-room (best), TONS of customers coming out of the seams, I mean like cocroaches tons, like climbing over the walls tons (worst). Hope this helps! IF you can work for Apple, THEN DO, they are the best company, you may interview like 7 times before they hire you, just know  to keep trying, they like persistence. Working at apple offers a good experience and lets you feel secure knowing you're part of the most valuable company on earth. There are a lot of places to grow within Apple but if you stay in Apple Care for a while, know that it can wear on you. Working at Apple had its ups and downs and it was a fast paced call center environment. I loved assisting customers and trouble shooting different Apple products. It was a different issue daily and I learned a lot. The company is exceptional and organized, It take pride in their employees and also in the benefit of the Company. I have nothing to say bad about the company beside the time off and the point for attendance. Worked for Apple retail it was a great experience, I recomend to every young personal wanting to learn how to get in to the sales force they teach you alot Apple is an amazing work place with excellent culture. Product basically sales its self! Important to always keep the APPLE steps of service in your mind, when approaching... I worked there for years. It was awesome until i started getting harassed. Reporting to management did absolutely no good. My poor attendance (didn't feel comfortable at work) ended up being used against me by management to over shadow my complaints. Fantastic company to work for with a great work and life balance. Multiple ways to take time off for a variety of issues that can arise in life. Would highly recommend to anyone. The company did give me the opportunity to grow as a professional individual and the first 4 years were one of the most magical and ambitions but with time and growth,  Apple began to hired externally. Great benefits and team placement. Great place to work. Fun, and fast paced. Would highly recommend if available in your area. Excellent training provided, good hands on before cutting you loose on the floor with live customers. Very good place to get call center and customer service experience. Apple tends to be very compartmentalized. Technical support advisors are often not informed of known issues which makes the job more difficult. Aside from that, it was a fun environment. The culture of Apple is unbeatable. The benefits make you feel like they really value their employees. The only downside is that it is kind of one of those places that feels like you have so much room to grow, but you never actually get where you want. Typical work day at Apple personally was a great experience to connect with different customers on their needs for personal or business needs. Management always make improvements depending on the needs of the business each day. Biggest opportunity Apple has taught me is being confident each day when  working on the floor by approaching customers and be comfortable in customer issues. In the end i quit the job because the manager that replaced the one that hired me was horrible and created a hostile work environment for me, i would go back to work there if I could, but the manger i quit on has put out bad word on me Great place to work. Great incentives and work life balance.  Great local management.  Would definitely  recommend as a work place for people to apply. Fun, team-based environment. I learned how to manage in a fast-paced and busy environment. It is a learning atmosphere that allows for personal and professional growth. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. I loved working for Apple it was the best company i ever worked just had an issue with not having enough hours because it was so many employees but other than that i loved it. They are very focused and know what they want. This was a contract project. They do provide good training and high standards. Once you get your project they trust you to make your own decisions. Great place to work for. Clean environment. Great management. Flexible schedules. Great employees. Easy to move up in the company. Easy calls to take. Awesome perks, coffee shop and full cafeteria menu for breakfast and lunch. They also have great networking events to learn more about other departments within Apple. But like most (huge) corporate companies, it can be strict and super official - not suited for the creative souls. The Apple ASC program is great. There are some advancement options but the portions are getting even more competitive and the company gets more popular and successful. We will have an opportunity to work for any technology that we are interested. Everyone in the floor were grouped together with 6 people per cabin that makes us work collaboratively. Sometimes it is quiet disturbed while some group of people discuss something in a loud. Good job, good management, very well run company. Compensation is ok but benefits are fantastic. Makes it hard to leave the company which is always a good thing. Fast Pace. Great benefits. Lots of opportunities, but very competitive. Great workplace culture. If you have a friend that works for the company ask for a referral. At the time I rececieved an invitation take an opportunity in California, it was a risk I was not sure I wanted to take. I had been with Apple for 6 years at the time and did not a Amy to jeopardize my growth with the company. Apple was my home surrounded with passionate and focused people who were not only very cunning but tallented and generous. The life lessons that remain with me to this day I adopted from the culture of loving you work and challenging yourself. great place to work, benefits are great even for part time employees, management can be a bit mis understood due to lack of communication because of products launches. but overall a great company. Culture of collaboration to make everyone feel a part of the team. Management worked with staff on their career development goals, touching base with you frequently to keep you on track. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I was able to work with and get to know. I loved the customers that came in. The quality of the products and the ease of use was the funniest thing to train customers on. Yet, everything was so professional, from the whole team to what you could accomplish with all the various Apple products. At home position via Kelly Services, sent computer and peripherals directly to my home. Virtual training, difficult to navigate between Kelly & Apple. I loved being developed and up to date with technology. Apple puts you in position to be able to help people everyday while keep you tech skill current in today’s society. It was a great training program, even if you've never used an Apple device. The employees were all happy and professional in helping you grow. The benefits were great even if you were working part-time. You just sat at a desk for your shift answering calls at home. Management pushed a happy attitude on you which would be expected especially over the phone communication. Hardest part of the job is obviously the customers. Working at Apple is not wonderful. The benefits and campus are great, but the people are pretty terrible. The climate is extremely political and you must be in the office clique to get ahead. Overall on a busy day my staff and I work as a team, we make sure our patients are taken care of  and get are patients in out as fast as we can with the best service This is such a good work space like honestly i'm really digging the vibes here and that makes me so much more motivated to working here and its pretty cool to be honest! So yeah ill see you at work one day maybe in like a few years or so. There isn't anything that comes to mind that I can say negatively about my position with Apple. I started at an extremely fair pay and work in an environment where the managers care more about your personal development than any sale. Truly unheard of and remarkable. It was a great work place because there were only a few people working in my dept. The pace was fast and testing the devices were simple. Communication with supervisor was easy because she was very hands on Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. I took my talents and experience to Apple at a time when Apple was about to bust out with the iPhone and later with the iPad.  I had a good time overall and the food at the cafe was well prepared (LOL).  Overall, wish I could have gotten into the music business aspect of the company because that was where my love was at but felt that making that move would have been difficult due to having to relocate to Silicone Valley in order to attempt a change. I love this company. They take care of there employee by any means and if there is anything that happens in your personal life they are there for support and comfort. i feel like we are a family and that i would be missed if i left even though the application period is long the job  makes up for it. If you are looking to just pick up a decent paycheck with no real experience, then this is the place to be. The hiring feels like they are randomly pulling names out of a hat. For a retail job, it pays more than average, however, for the amount of stress you are put through, it is not worth it. They preach about how much they care about work/life balance and how much they care about their people, but do not actually stand by it. Apple retail in my experience is the best retail chain you can work for. The people are great and the benefits are really good. They helped me pay for my bachelor's degree but there's a pretty low ceiling with management spots rarely opening up and usually filled from outside Apple. Good people wish I could have worked there longer but the temp contract ran out due to the battery program being canceled nationwide. Extremely difficult to get hired though Apple even with a foot in the door I worked for a third party call center for Apple. It was great gaining that call center/technical support experience. But the pay was horrible, 11.50 a hour, they changed your schedule without telling you, iMessage was unprofessional because coworkers were extremely unprofessional. Managers gave no guidance hardly. The month training was helpful but it was really like working at a military base. There was also no Human Resources it was just 'workforce management' Apple is a workplace of enjoyable nature, but one that should be taken into consideration when doing something like technical support.  Be mentally ready for this. There was not enough time to train and get familiar with the new products before taking calls from Apple customers. We often had to multi-task to get the job done and help customers in at a rapid pace.It was constant negativity in the work place from upper management , that would bring down the employees spirits and commitment to the job. Loved developing my Apple tech skills and learning to keep up in a fast-paced, competitive work environment. I loved learning customer service skills and the many benefits that came with working for a large, forward-thinking company. I was being constantly harassed by an assistant manager, and when brought to HR attention, they did not investigate. The manager would consistently take me behind closed doors and berate me with vulgar language and question my character. She had a reputation for treating many people like this and had been reported to HR several times after I left the company. Great place to grow. You have tons of opportunity to train and learn new things in a high paced tech environment. Management is fair and wants to see you succeed. a great place to work as long as you do what you are required to do. No pressure from supervisors as long as you do your job right. supervisor and colleagues very cooperative . Creative, productive learning environment where you are allowed to make decisions and learn to think on your feet. Enjoyed making friends with my colleagues, enjoyed learning more about Apple and technology in general. Loved being a part of the Apple culture for five years. I sincerely enjoyed working for Apple. The in depth training and consistent motivations were a plus. Would have continued working there is I hadn't had to relocate. Fun, fast paced environment working with people all day. The company and leaders put a lot of resources into employee development and empowers us to be our own leaders.It's a very open and safe culture, and leadership encourages employees to deliver feedback without the fear of retaliation, both with the leadership team themselves and the employees you work with. Getting to wear close to whatever best represents you is also a plus (tattoos, piercings, etc).Even with little to no experience in technology, training is provided to all employees.The most difficult part of the job can be the lack of work/life balance especially as a full timer. Retail demands open availability and that means no consistency with scheduling. Great place to work with a lot of great people but at the end of the day, it's retail. I enjoyed working there a lot but I have a full time job and my work/life balance became difficult to maintain Apple is a great place to work if your looking for experience in the field of computers or looking to increase your experience with cooking. There is plenty of room to move up and advance in whatever field you are apart of. Worked  independently, enjoyed working at Apple, learned a lot about technology, management was easy to work with.timings were flexible.Work had to be completed within the schedule Excellent retail environment. Great place to work for a young person or anyone who doesn't mind the retail hours/weekends long term. Very flexible for a part time person going to school. I liked the people I worked with. A typical day at work was 8 hours. Although I liked my team, I felt we could have been more interactive. I would have loved it if there were snacks in the building. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. great place to work and excellent if you make it your life.good benefits, decent pay. advancement in the company wasn't easiest to come by. Great discounts. I worked at Apple as a site support consultant for several months. My time there was enjoyable and the people there are very helpful. I would highly recommend working there. Conduent is the company that I work for and Apple is their client. Conduent as a company is sorry, poor scheduling, unorganized, sudden changes daily on the job. Apple itself is all right to work for overall, but its customers are immature and unreasonable, which makes the job stressful. During the release of new products: especially the iPhone: it is a terrible time to work in customer service for them. Not much support and you're left alone to be 'eaten alive' by their customers. Great Benefits and excellent people to work with and grow with from a technology standpoint, excellent benefits and great atmosphere. Would recommend this job to anyone The colleagues around you are creative, innovative, fun and easy going. However, management team is not that friendly. To achieve the sales target or other index, they will do whatever it takes and neglect staff's feeling.Another benefit of working at Apple is that you could get employee discount for yourself and your friends.Overall, I love workin at Apple! Overall, Apple is a cool company to work for. In retail, the hours can be a pro or con. It's nice to have a random day off in the week when you need it, but not having weekends is a drag sometimes. The benefits are great, but the pay doesn't usually match the cost of living of areas stores are located. For the most part customers are pleasant, but we put up with a fair amount of entitled and rude people from day to day which can be draining. You don't have to know too much about the products or be super 'techie' to start; on-the-job training and learning through experience is usually sufficient. Coworkers come from a variety of backgrounds and are generally very supportive of one another. The work environment is inclusive. Uniform is simple, provided, comfortable. Every day is different depending on your role and due to constantly changing services and new products you are always learning. Customer service experience at the store and feedback-driven culture will provide lifelong transferrable skills. when i first started it was ok, but then they started having issues with they system and the employee was , getting blamed for being  late, well when they found about about the issue they promise employee that attendance would be fixed and it didn't happened, it was seem like they only hired people for the Holiday of Christmas  and then after that then it was time to start letting people go and boy was they. They also waited til they devices was working well and they had enough people to handle the problem calls. I think this because it was people who had over 20 occurrences and did didn't get let go til after the Holiday was over and the returned and problems was figured out and deal with then we all lost our jobs.... I worked through 3 different programs as APAC/NCO and Apple was not the worst in terms of structure and procedural guidance, but more so in the sense of job stress. When moving up to tier 2 support, I was given an unsubstantial (agreed) raise to go from front line phone support to senior adviser level. This presented a much more ambiguous nature of problems from guests, with the added responsibility of owning each unresolved case and providing those callers my work schedule and phone extension. This caused me to eventually overthink about work problems outside of work, and I became more miserable. This was in the later stages of APAC's business partnership with Apple and soon after the partnership was severed. Apple was merged into the already existing Best Buy program, which ultimately was the catalyst for me to find something better. If you are not in the right social circle you go nowhere.There training is bad and there are alot of people there that are rude.The management has no understanding that everyone has a life outside of apple. Fun, a lot of on the job learning. Many opportunities to learn, help, and grow. Loved getting free software and nice discounts. Most people working here were hired for their love of bringing people together through technology. Worked at an Apple store for almost 2 years. Wages of new hires with less experience are higher than what the raises give you which is extremely frustrating. When in meetings and talking about this, management always says 'we are working on it'. Essentially nothing is ever done about this.Store meetings are epic waste of time and only good for free food and extra paid time for showing up. Management doesn't listen to employees input and simply changes their strategy every single meeting. Communication on new practices and strategies in store is horrible and the management likes to change store strategy every other week especially with the genius bar.  Find something that works well enough and stick to it. Never ending fight to figure out how to please both customer and employee.Getting a promotion is difficult and management likes to come up with any reason they can to not give people positions. I think they need to stop hiring managers from Target. I recommend that everyone try and apply for Apple. You learn a lot and make some of the best people that become family. I enjoyed the thrill of helping with a solution to peoples problems and love the face to face engagement I had there Apple provided me with all the tools to be successful at work and even in life. Learned a lot and made life-long friends.They give you all the resource to do your job and then some. The pay is competitive and aligns with the work you are doing. AHA college program provides maximum amount of untaxed tuition reimbursement yearly and provides a solid source of income with a very flexible schedule for college students. Apple is a great place to work with a fantastic environment. The facility is amazing with so many resources available to you. I truly enjoyed the people I worked with. Working at Apple was fun because it brings together a diverse group of people who all have cool backgrounds and stories to tell. Furthermore, the work environment is well maintained and an enjoyable place to be while on the clock. - Cross-functional project teams- Regular meetings with managers and teams- Opportunity for presentations to executive level audience- Great benefits A great place to work if you’re a patient person. It could be stressful at times but all customer service positions can be. It wasn’t hard but I don’t believe they provide adequate training. Fine work environment, no more than 40 hours expected, but boring work with poor management and little to no chance of being hired full-time. Good for a starting job in GIS straight out of school but thats it. Apple the company is AWESOME.  The company is great as long as you are an actual employee.  If you are a contractor then there is a noticeable difference in how you’re treated.  Apple is one of the few companies that will hire you for contract, but won’t convert you to a full fledge Apple Employees . Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. The culture at the company is decidedly unpleasant.  My own manager was constantly violating company policy and hitting on the women in his group.  The work experience was overall not good. AppleCare At-Home is a great job while in college or in-between careers jobs. Advancement opportunities are few and far between. There is always opportunity for lateral movement but you WILL NOT be paid any more. You'll just have more responsibilities.Scheduling can be tough if you're not a high performer, you'll be stuck in a schedule that you did not want at all. If you are a high performer, you can pretty much get the schedule you want. Most managers are fantastic, there are a few bad apples (no pun intended). Management routinely hired from outside despite qualified candidates working in store for 5+ years. Constant increase in sales goals even for technicians. Be ready to spin conversations. “A place for everything, and everything in its place” describes a typical day at work for Apple retail. Each team member has specific roles and specific zoning to accomplish the goals for the day, which include facilitating sales of Apple hardware, offering training opportunities for customers, and providing customer-facing customer support at the Genius Bar. Apple is open to innovation, inclusion, and diversity, but as a global company it can take time to implement change.The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to meet a diverse range of creative individuals, both internally as coworkers and externally as customers. The hardest part of the job is balancing passions and interests outside of work with a sometimes unpredictable retail work schedule. Working with apple as tier 1 tech support my job consisted of answering phones and building a short term relationship with the customer, and doing a short report on the customer issue, an doing what’s necessary to keep our apple device holders up and running While it was fun and exciting to work for Apple, keep in mind that this is a business and profits are part of the sales. If you don't like selling, this isn't the job for you. If you like helping people and enhancing lives through technology, it really helps to know how each of the products work with one another. Product knowledge is key. -Work like:  You have a set schedule every 6 months-What I learned: I have learned a lot about building relationships with customers, peers, and management-Management: My management experience has been great. All were encouraging making sure to praise me for my successes and offer solutions for areas of opportunity. Apple took great care of their employees. They made sure we were trained and had ample knowledge of the product. The only down side of the job was the management turn over at the time I was there. A typical day at work meant clocking in five minutes before your shift and clocking out right on time assuming you weren't in a call with a customer. The job allows for pretty good work/life balance. Management is professional. Training is exceptional, even for people who don't necessarily understand technology. Hardest part of the job is, naturally, the customers. It's easy for people to disrespect you when they don't see your face. But the team environment makes it tolerable. Everyone is very aware of the issues and is supportive. get in to work and get ready for the day, management would have a meeting with us to go over anything new/upcoming. Management was very helpful and always had a solution to any problem that arose. Apple is a great place to work.  Engaged management, engaged employees all led to an amazing teamwork environment.  Helping customers find their ideal technology solution is very rewarding. Many meetings daily.Not a good place (NPI) for new grads as this environment requires some real world knowledge and there is very little time for training. Learned more than I expected. Would recommend this company to anyone. Certainly you learn a lot about technology, but you learn valuable people and communication skills. siri project work, contractor. Interesting work but not good deal as a contractor. No benefits and long commute. Interesting skill development but no progression. As T2 I take a lot of chats and take over a lot of chats from other Advisors. I have learned to support all Apple devices and there are a number of mandatory training courses that must be passed to continue. I work from home which is a plus, there is a stipend from Apple for Internet and Phone service. The hardest part of the job is providing support for unhappy users and getting your CSAT scores to a high level when most of the time dealing with users who are less than happy with situations with the Apple Store, Products, or other Advisors they have spoken with. The best part is paid time off and discounts for yourself, friends, and family. I didn't really like it, hard to move up within the company. The schedules didn't fit me because i have children and when i got hired they made it seam that they would work with me There was no work life balance could have days off for school. Management was there most of the time. Some days we would only have one manger on the floor while others were in the office. This company bought New Bell.  I worked there almost 19 years prior to this sale.  They gave me a raise and then out of the blue, let me go.  No explanation was given for my dismissal. I think it was so they could bring in their own people.  They did however give me severance pay.  The loyalty  was there on my part, not on theirs. Wish I could've made a living working for apple because it is absolutely a wonderful place to work! I learned a lot about the products, about sales, a huge amount about customer service and how to always put the customer first. Pretty much decent in terms of work life balance need to work through every day even after office hours and manager was not good kept bugging as micor management terms of work Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. The space is beautiful, the work is challenging, the culture is great. I love working with talent and curating programs. Every day is different. I also learned a lot about event planning and management. When you clock in for work you have a download of what the day is with other team members ... Then you hit the floor and change people lives for the best its a job, its an ok tech job. as a contractor you have to be on work on time if you are late by 15 mins you have to email HR explaining why you where late. we had meeting at begging of the day telling us what the plan for that shift was. there is a hierarchy and most of the people where nice. the deadlines where hard deadlines and failure to meet them you where harshly dealt with. there is a constant feeling of micro management which is standard for any tech job. the facilities where ok and the environment was quite. as a contractor you are bottom of the food chain, but at times I did feel important to the project. the best part is probably the co workers, I made a lot of friends and encountered people I never would have on my own. I would do another job like this, but this time I would be a little bit more prepared to the sudden drop that happens to most contract works in california. super chill workplace. they give you a lot of independence but they count on you coming through with what you have to do. they really encourage a community aspect. management is laid back and doesn't micromanage, but will press if you're slacking. apple is a great company to work for; it is very positively influential, and the company is really all about its people. Great company, Very fast paced! Things change very quickly so you will have to be on your toes! I would not leave, but just for me, I'm looking for a career change. Joining Apple is  joining a cult. Spend lots of time talking about how great the company is while corporate continually undervalues and underpays retail. I loved Apple great people great environment clean and really good management lots of fun things to do great way to win stuff from apple good hours always has over time avaliable Apple retail is a clique. If you're not in it, you get no reward for working there. The red tape and politics in this company is overwhelming. If you're up for the stress of it, then go for it. Team leads stand over your shoulder to listen to every word you say so they can come back to you and tell you what you said wrong - and occasionally what you said right.  Most of the co-workers, however, are amazing people. You can make some great friends working there. But Management is a different story. Many of them left Apple to work for Microsoft. Interesting. I think my time there was great but I was in the wrong roll where I did not see myself staying longer then I did. If givern the chance, I would work in a different department. Disaster Place to work for. No help at all. You feel that you are alone.No brainstorming. Very poor feasibility study towards complicated & very difficult task. Managers are usually not very technical. no respect for knowledge. You must discuss technical detail of you project on the lowest common denominator of all other members of the Committee you belong to, but as you are usually the only subject expert, none understand what you are trying to explain. Apple as a company is amazing. They have a brilliant culture that focuses on diversity, empathy, and fearlessness. I felt at home during the on-boarding process. The store that I worked had the worse turnover rate, especially among management. There was gross misuse of power, racism, sexism, homophobia, and that again is just from management.I love the company still after the horrendous experience that I had at my store. It would be great if management took the same empathic approach to their staff that they do with customers.  There is also a lack of diversity in upper management which may play a part in the lack of empathy for people of color. Great experience for a 1st job out of college but little to no room for moving up as a contractor. Someone who works hard gets paid the same as someone messing around all day. Apple Beer Bashes are a great time. Apple WAH is a great career opportunity! I would recommend to everyone. Everyone is very friendly and are willing to help if you are struggling or have questions. As a Technical Specialist at the Genius Bar you'll feel the pressure of being fast and efficient. Regardless, the work is incredibly rewarding and a fun experience overall. When I first started working at Apple Retail we weren’t treated like retail employees. We were treated fairly without the stress of playing politics or worrying about hitting numbers for management. This is no longer the case. They are pushing retail harder and harder and the culture has completely changed. The pay here used to be competitive but now other chains like Target AT&T and Verizon are quickly catching up and surpassing. However the benefits are excellent and the people you work with are wonderful. Great place to meet others that are capable of growing through ambiguity, a huge skill in today’s technical world. Working at an Apple Store retail location can become somewhat stressful due to retail hours over the weekend. Apple is a best job retail you can have in the market without formal an education. There room for advancement  but theres a lot of favoritism involved. Theres a lot perks, but part timers get the short end of the stick. My best advice is do things the 'Apple Way' and try move up to full-time fast as possible because they don't hired full timers right away unless you are some computer nerd or major. Best at home job to work for. Very relaxed. Good money, easy to work with. The job sent me everything I needed to complete all task. Never had a problem. Was in school at the time. Nice work culture. Management is ok. There is some obligations for contractors which do not allow them to enter the restricted bay.rest is okay not too great. I train lots of people. I love teaching people to get the most out of technology and enable them to do more. I avoided any drama with coworkers for my entire multiyear career. I think everyone was very focused on making an important impact on people's lives through technology and creativity. It is busy and fast paced most of the time. Some customers certainly can misplace responsibility of how technology works, not taking accountability for themselves. Most customers just want a great experience and will partner with you to achieve that. Working at Apple is unlike anywhere else; managers actually care about you and your co-workers work together as a team. While things may get hectic or busy, we feed off of that energy to make every customer interaction unique and rich. The work is very organized with respect to the tasks assigned to each one. A lot of review and follow up with your work. Deadlines are important. Great team culture. I love working here! It is great being an at home advisor. The benefits and pay are great. Customers can be rude but thats the job. I would definitely recommend, Must apply! Great place to work, benefits amazing, stock options, and fun place to work at. Company focus' on development but not as much career advancement. I recommend this gig as a stepping stone to IT, plus Apple looks great on a resume. The culture and benefits were amazing!  And the customers come into the store with a love for you, so it is really easy for the most part to do your job.  Money and career advancement could have been better, but overall, it was a great place to work! Great work environment.  Everyone respects everyone.  Good opportunities for growth and development and over all just a fun place to work.  Great perks. If you have children, this may not be the job for you. They say its a set schedule but they will randomly do shift bids. They are very inconsistent  with with their policies, and constantly change your Team leader. I had a specific schedule I logged into the phone to take inbound calls.  I get a call and take calls and have to meet specific metric for how long on a call, what you did on the call, how much time was spend between inbound and call so you had to go directly into receive a new call as soon as the previous call ended.  The customer did feed back on you as to how the call was handled.  I thought the hardest part was getting notes in the account and troubleshooting the issues.  It was best to have templates and word expansions for the notes but then you worked so many different products sometimes I would forget the template code name I created, especially if it was a call I did not have often.  I loved the job for the most part.  Did not like the scheduling that was what I disliked the most. Fast working environment where I get to collaboriate with a number of various talented beings which I get to learn from every day. This allows me to grow and further my knowledge on things surrounding me in the work place. Store culture and Management are the key to Employee  experience. You have a good management team you will have a great time working for Apple. i was in college during my time at apple, and love it Great positions for me as a college student. Flexibility of working from home and company worked around my school schedule. Have had almost 5 managers in my 2 years which is frustrating but they have been good managers for the most part. Working for Apple as a Genius is... stressful. The customers are more often than not already upset when they get to you and the pace doesn't always allow for good break in that.That said, they do a very good job of teaching you the skills you need to handle that. You will learn a LOT while working there, both on the technical and the people skills side of things so that you can calm that upset customer down and address their issue. Organized structured yet easy going environment..overall cool place to work for sure.they gave me the run around about keeping me past the season which I was hired for and it was not clearing displayed as seasonal when I applied. I would strongly recommend working in Apple. The best years in my career have been there and I did some incredible work.If you like fast paced, challenging and fulfilling environment thats the place. Great benefits, you meet a lot of cool people, easy to get in a role that is hard to ever advance from, managers can vary a lot but some are more worried about covering their own butts/ shirking responsibility than advocating for their people. By far, the best job I've had. Contact jobs at Apple are less than ideal because it will end. My manager was very 'hands off'. We hardly saw him. If you are a contractor, part of your day should be looking for a full time position with the company. If you want to stay. No transparency or visibility, very private. Not collaborative with external partners. Lots of red tape for projects. Gives great experience in tech industry. Zero communication with me on when the job ended. Went to lunch and was told my contract was over. No warning whatsoever. Based on that, I'll never consider applying for Apple again. Are you willing to give up who you are to become what they want you to be?  Share your opinions only if they line up politically with the company.  Pay and benefits are amazing, but at some point you have to drink the Kool-aid. I spent 4 1/2 years at Apple.  It was the most memorable time of my life.  I made wonderful peers and friends.  I learned what a community was supposed to be.  I learned what loving yourself and your work means. Great work environment! Apple has an amazing ability to attract amazing people, which in turn, creating an amazing work culture and environment. The leadership has a established a place of learning and that includes mistakes, that you inevitably make. They care more about your growth as an individual. "
