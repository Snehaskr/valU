Great Place to WorkGood Work Life Balance.Involved with NVIDIA Partner – Digital River for building Promotion and Coupon discount Applications for NVIDIA products.  Also included Delivery of Interface efforts with SalesForce.com.●	Also involved in RFQs and Vendor Evaluation Process for optimizing DAM – Digital Asset Management needs for NVIDIA and built forecasting/budget models for various business groups. NVIDIA has poor management. They do not treat their new employees respectfully.There was a lot of bad mouthing and discriminating within the company. It was a great company and it helped me continue to grow my skills as an Reworks Specialist, but the employees did not help me improve. This aw a very rewarding job for the first 12 years. The company changed and I have worked in several groups. My current group dosen't use my skill set. My current management is very poot I have been a specialist for 3 years now and it's very hard to get promoted as a campaign manager. I have worked in many different departments and have shown success. They want to keep the organization flat, which is great because I have visibility to many departments and work with VPs, but I don't feel I'm being nurtured as a young person to be set up for success down the road. Everyone is incredibly willing to teach you the product if you aren't a technical person. When there is a product launch, we 'swarm' and everyone helps. CEO has visibility into everything and wants to be involved, which is awesome yet stressful. Now that NVIDIA is on the map for AI & deep learning and our stock is doing well, unfortunately the politics of a big company are starting to come with it. I hope NVIDIA can push the politics out and remain true to its roots. Since working as a contractor, didn't know when they would let us go.  This is always a challenge when you're not a permanent employee.  But I'm still open to temporary or permanent work. NVIDIA's culture does not allow for worklife balance.  There is to much politics and a tremendous amout of micro management.  If you have a life and desire to spend time with your family, NVIDIA is not the place for you.  The culture is old school with an average age in the 40s, you won't find any free snacks or lunch.  But, dinner is always free because they want you to stay late.  However, their benefits are top notch.The CEO is amazing and runs the company very well.  However, he does need to coach his leadership in HR to allow people to do what they were hired to do instead of micro managing them right out of the company. Wrote chip yield analysis software automate a previous manual excel based process to a multi role web site that different categories of individuals could access, allocate chips and have them delivered.  This would improve the chip yield analysis for Nvidia processors like the Tensor Core, Titan V, 12nm solution. Maintain the Data Center, running fibre , set up and install of basic routers and switches, install bsic windows servers and remote support systems, manage monitoring all data center equipment. Mixed feelings, the best and worst times in my career. Early years were 2X growth over 6 years with 24/7 attention to the job. Compensation, Stock as you'd expect. Sudden shift in attitude in 2004 and became a cut throat environment. No idea post 2006. The role of a material coordinator consisted of making sure all packages were received. Then, after all packages were received we had to sort them out. I came to Nvidia rather early in my career.  As such, I was ready after 5 years to take on new challenges.  It was difficult for me to move up in the company without having prior experience in PM work.  I ultimately left to obtain real world PM experience in the CM world. -A typical day when I worked there consisted of prioritizing software certification builds, getting testing underway, and reporting on or updating bugs as they rolled in.-I learned tons about software testing and certification.-Management was OK, but I was in a team removed from the main SQA management team.-Work place culture was top shelf!-The hardest part of my job were the inconsistent hours, kicking off drivers at midnight, etc..-The most enjoyable part was being part of a world class organization.. I miss Nvidia circa 2003..I cannot say enough good things about Nvidia, I found it difficult to move up within the company, because my role there had me somewhat pigeonholed.  Aside from this though, they really do take good care of their emplyees.  I would work there again in heartbeat! Highly recommended for intern and newly graduate.  Pay rate are low in hourly or salary.  Allow employees to transfer to different department if accept but manager can disapprove even got accepted by other department. Quite demanding and always under tremendous pressure to challenge status quo. Nevertheless, it's very rewarding environment for the super-achiever employees. Challenging work , good work-life balance. Amazing food and perks. Managers are super busy and technical. Everyone is working towards common goal for the company. Everyone is technically smart. didn't enjoy my time here. Didn't have any opportunity to grow and expand my skills and knowhow. No support from management to get better at your job and contribute to new and innovative ways. Out of all the companies ive worked at nvidia has a place place for me.  The company is doing amazing things in the tech space and it was an exciting thing to be part of it Nvidia offers a very fast paced dynamic work environment. I enjoyed working there on latest technologies. Being a Program Manager, I had to work with a geographically diverse development and QA teams. Learned lot of new technologies from Nvidia like SCCM, office 365 migration etc. developed troubleshooting skills. very good environment to work. Thanks Loved this place, company culture is a bit dilute compared to the good old days (2009 lots of nepotism) but still a great place to work today. Moving more toward a general corporate culture, but if you're interested in a company that allows you to grow while enjoying high levels of professionalism they are for you. Nvidia was a very fun and exciting place to work for as an intern. They held several intern events and the work was actually relevant to my field of study. I got to work on real projects and learn practical skills that will help me in my career. The lab was productive and collaborative as the workers tested chips and had to take care of certain roles and desires by the company. Tasks included testing chips, organizing, management. My work team was a great environment for me, lots of collaboration and focus on doing whatever it took to get the job done and going outside of typical responsibilities.  Unfortunately, due to some internal politics, our group was disbanded.  It was a lot of fun to be part of Silicon Valley company with aggressive release targets, though at the same time very stressful. Constant firefighting in a complicated Linux environment.  Including all aspects of troubleshooting LFS job sceduler and underlying Linux and NFS environment. There is a lot of work to be done and management is committed to too many features/product. There is not enough people to do all the work and as a result people are shifted around most of the time.The infrastructure and the work-flow is really slow and cumbersome and it is impossible to move fast. Challenging roles , smart and hardworking people . The environment makes you want to learn more because there is so much to do. Only cons would be the long hours. There is a lot of chance for you to get higher payment and chance to get higher level. This is good environment to work. Friendly coworker always help you and show how to do. It took too long for me to be rotated into a fulltime employee and once that happened a new VP came in with other ideas and got rid of people that he felt were not necessary. Human resources was a mess. The management is out of touch with employees, making for an unpleasant work environment. Work life balance for the department was non-existent. We were expected to be available at all times. Management would say otherwise, but if you did not respond after hours, you were questioned about why. Everything is fine. I am happy with everything. The environment and co employees were awesome. The manager is really awesome. Team lead is really really awesome good enviroment to work, had chances to work at different departments, friendly place, not much to learn, not much chance to get hiring as permanent, not a security job, no benefits The culture at Nvidia is very relaxed, and i enjoyed that aspect of it. people would always get the job done and required little supervision to do so. A typical day at work would be inventory parts before testing them, and setting up test station for process to begin. Majority of hours were rotating shifts with other technicians to make sure all testing was complete. Most aspects of Nvidia were enjoyable.  As long as you had a good manager you could really enjoy your experience working with them. I would go back if given the opportunity. pretty quite and professional working environment,can always get what you need for work quickly, people there are every efficient and friendly. highly motivated and capable engineers.  Management in some divisions can be quite challenging.  The perks here are definitely limited compared to top companies like Google. I was only a contractor but still was able to enjoy the many perks of working at Nvidia.  They definitely do their best to promote from within.  Cafeteria options were very  nice. The projects were fair but to be a contractor there for a year and let go because the project ended and there was no more funds wasnt very fair. The culture of people were intresting but fair. The enjoyable days there when working very hard together to get many different projects done with quality and time efficient. I did an internship at NVIDIA after my sophomore year of college. It was a productive time, I got to play with a laser and help the camera division caliberate cameras. They trusted me with many responsibilities and it was rewarding. Management can easily loose the temper without apology. It is expected to follow the order from the top without thinking. Management does not care about employees's grow and learning. In order to achieve their goal, manager can lie about the truth. Working environment is stressful. Great place to work. Good work life balance. Workplace culture is very good. Management is very nice and approachable. Great workplace with no micromanagement. Work is paced based on the team needs and work timings are really flexible.Managers are really helpful and respond quickly to the team needs.Overall a very open and friendly environment to work in. The lab was productive and collaborative as the workers tested chips and had to take care of certain roles and desires by the company. Tasks included testing chips, organizing, management. Nvidia is a good work place. It's centrally located close to 101, and 280 freeway.Managers are good and well trainedPeople enjoy coming to work and feel appreciated, acknowledged and rewarded. Creativity, productivity and thinking outside the box flourish.Employees give 200 percent. They strive to be the best and to deliver top-quality products and services. They take responsibility for their actions and decisionsKindness and understanding prevail when employees face challenges such as accidents, illnesses, personal tragedies and natural disasters. People will usually go the extra mile for others when they’re treated well and with understanding, compassion and respect People are friendly.  Really organized.  I learned a lot about the systems and how everything worked at the site.  Management was great.  The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company. Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously. Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here. Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5. Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale. Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc). Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia. it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company. As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the 'hopes' of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do. One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA. fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the manager Management is off hand which provides personal growth There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth. Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual Reality This was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry. The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent. highly talented peoplegood managementgood base packageco-workers support is very goodgood work-life balanceCompany always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets. Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around. Learning and Development team at Nvidia is fairly new and still going through growing pains. There is immense potential for great stuff here but the lack of accountability is the crux of the problem. A lot of the times we over promise and under deliver. That doesn't help matters for a young team that is still finding a place of its own. My grouse is that we are still considered a non essential function and pretty much operate like a service organization instead of being strategic! This was my first professional job. I suffered a lot but also learned a lot from my co workers and colleagues! Even though I left that industry but I still miss them! The lab was productive and collaborative as the workers tested chips and had to take care of certain roles and desires by the company. Tasks included testing chips, organizing, management. Loved working here.  I probably learned the most about being QA here than anywhere else.  The people are all great and never was left without equipment to test with. This company provides lunch and dinner to employees for 50centsFlexible working schedulesAllows you to work from home if needed Nvidia is a cutting edge company and you get to learn a lot from highly competent people. I learnt a lot in just 3 months of my internship. Compensation is at or above market.  The company provides competitive benefits, except for the 401K, which is not comparable to other large companies.  Compelling technologies and products. NVIDIA is well positioned because of its presence in GPUs, High Performance Computing, AP & Mobile Connectivity to take advantage of opportunities in Automotive world. Mobile connectivity is something that they need to take a deeper & serious look into though, given the serious competition. Develop functional simulation and I learned to validated, verified and analyzed graphic microchip. Mangement are good processing of dealing with controlling things or people. And co-workers are worked with the team. Bad: Little or no organization, very little processes, micromanaging management, managers who were great individual contributors but horrible people managers. Too political an environment.Good pay, decent work life balance. Two major tasks of this intern position:One is to clean up VCS warnings and provide the specific fix.Another is to analyze CPU usage in Verilog simulation. Modify design codes to minimize simulation time.The most enjoyable part of this work experience is people in Nvidia are really excellent and helpful. Even though I work independently, I never feel alone. The most hardest part of this job is to figure out how the company manage the whole chip design flow. Great place to work, highly passionate people, long work hours and tend to have multiple projects in same time. I like working at NVIDIA for the culture and the friendly people.  Unfortunately, the work I'm doing is not very fulfilling for me, and there are no opportunities for what I want to be doing at the location that I'm at. -New Challenges everyday-Very nice colleagues-Good Product great place to learn for NCGs. Good management team, no politics. nothing to complainstill have star-up culturevery busygreat for an intern experience The most fun and great place to workFriendly co-workersGreat work and life balance Love working there. Management was great, coworkers were fun to work with. It was good working there I worked on SDM and SDO project. Both these projects were focused around optimizing the customer supply chain. The new tool which I learned was Tablue. My typical work day consist of working side by side with product Engineering in accomplishing the task at hand. From doing bench work to testing and qualifying transceiver to production. Fun place to get your technical experience.  Lots of challenging project.  Management seems a bit fragmented and lacks a cohesive vision. average company, so many contractor, not many regular employee I was working the RF group where I worked on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and used CMU200, CMW500 to do LTE, CDMA and other RF testing. The lab was productive and collaborative as the workers tested chips and had to take care of certain roles and desires by the company. Tasks included testing chips, organizing, management. Every day we get to solves new challenges, bringing new technologies to live. Not only we get to work on these technologies, we also learn all their intrinsic details I got to play with high-tech hardware every day. They treated the employees great, and I worked with really intelligent people.I'd work for them again in a heartbeat! Great place to work and I wish I could work there longer but my contract has expired. I was covering for an employee out with long term illness. 6month contract, since Dec. 2012 who is returning. Typical day was reviewing supply and demand and ensuring support. i have enhanced my SAP skillset. It's great to be part of a company that innovates outstanding products. The work environment was relaxed and friendly but had strict guidelines for how the work got done. It was a perfect place for a software engineer to gain more knowledge about hardware specific jobs. I gained a lot of important knowledge using hardware and was able to apply my current knowledge to the position. fats paced, intelligent people, good food. sometimes a gap in communication - Fun and passionate group of peers to work with- Smart engineering team- Work-life balance can be challenging NVIDIA is a great place for innovation and vision. Jensen drives direction from the top down. The organization is very matrix and it's really about working cross functionally. The most enjoyable part is the people. The hardest part is the amount of work given the resources. I spent my time reviewing codes that ran on our products and competitors products. I looked at the data for run times and made marketing style graphs to clearly show that we were the best choice. Pretty good place to work. Great people. Somewhat lack of upward mobility. The 12-14 hours go by flying and still feel there's a lot more to do.I've learned to take plan well, take calculated risks, execute to the plan and succeed.Management wants you succeed and become productive by the day.The worlds best talent can be found here and in plenty.The hardest part is you end up working so much that you tend to forget anything beyond work.Too many things happen around to list the most enjoyable part of work at NVIDIA.

The lab was productive and collaborative as the workers tested chips and had to take care of certain roles and desires by the company. Tasks included testing chips, organizing, management. Great Place to WorkGood Work Life Balance.Involved with NVIDIA Partner – Digital River for building Promotion and Coupon discount Applications for NVIDIA products.  Also included Delivery of Interface efforts with SalesForce.com.●	Also involved in RFQs and Vendor Evaluation Process for optimizing DAM – Digital Asset Management needs for NVIDIA and built forecasting/budget models for various business groups. NVIDIA has poor management. They do not treat their new employees respectfully.There was a lot of bad mouthing and discriminating within the company. It was a great company and it helped me continue to grow my skills as an Reworks Specialist, but the employees did not help me improve. This aw a very rewarding job for the first 12 years. The company changed and I have worked in several groups. My current group dosen't use my skill set. My current management is very poot I have been a specialist for 3 years now and it's very hard to get promoted as a campaign manager. I have worked in many different departments and have shown success. They want to keep the organization flat, which is great because I have visibility to many departments and work with VPs, but I don't feel I'm being nurtured as a young person to be set up for success down the road. Everyone is incredibly willing to teach you the product if you aren't a technical person. When there is a product launch, we 'swarm' and everyone helps. CEO has visibility into everything and wants to be involved, which is awesome yet stressful. Now that NVIDIA is on the map for AI & deep learning and our stock is doing well, unfortunately the politics of a big company are starting to come with it. I hope NVIDIA can push the politics out and remain true to its roots. Since working as a contractor, didn't know when they would let us go.  This is always a challenge when you're not a permanent employee.  But I'm still open to temporary or permanent work. NVIDIA's culture does not allow for worklife balance.  There is to much politics and a tremendous amout of micro management.  If you have a life and desire to spend time with your family, NVIDIA is not the place for you.  The culture is old school with an average age in the 40s, you won't find any free snacks or lunch.  But, dinner is always free because they want you to stay late.  However, their benefits are top notch.The CEO is amazing and runs the company very well.  However, he does need to coach his leadership in HR to allow people to do what they were hired to do instead of micro managing them right out of the company. Wrote chip yield analysis software automate a previous manual excel based process to a multi role web site that different categories of individuals could access, allocate chips and have them delivered.  This would improve the chip yield analysis for Nvidia processors like the Tensor Core, Titan V, 12nm solution. Maintain the Data Center, running fibre , set up and install of basic routers and switches, install bsic windows servers and remote support systems, manage monitoring all data center equipment. Mixed feelings, the best and worst times in my career. Early years were 2X growth over 6 years with 24/7 attention to the job. Compensation, Stock as you'd expect. Sudden shift in attitude in 2004 and became a cut throat environment. No idea post 2006. The role of a material coordinator consisted of making sure all packages were received. Then, after all packages were received we had to sort them out. I came to Nvidia rather early in my career.  As such, I was ready after 5 years to take on new challenges.  It was difficult for me to move up in the company without having prior experience in PM work.  I ultimately left to obtain real world PM experience in the CM world. -A typical day when I worked there consisted of prioritizing software certification builds, getting testing underway, and reporting on or updating bugs as they rolled in.-I learned tons about software testing and certification.-Management was OK, but I was in a team removed from the main SQA management team.-Work place culture was top shelf!-The hardest part of my job were the inconsistent hours, kicking off drivers at midnight, etc..-The most enjoyable part was being part of a world class organization.. I miss Nvidia circa 2003..I cannot say enough good things about Nvidia, I found it difficult to move up within the company, because my role there had me somewhat pigeonholed.  Aside from this though, they really do take good care of their emplyees.  I would work there again in heartbeat! Highly recommended for intern and newly graduate.  Pay rate are low in hourly or salary.  Allow employees to transfer to different department if accept but manager can disapprove even got accepted by other department. Quite demanding and always under tremendous pressure to challenge status quo. Nevertheless, it's very rewarding environment for the super-achiever employees. Challenging work , good work-life balance. Amazing food and perks. Managers are super busy and technical. Everyone is working towards common goal for the company. Everyone is technically smart. didn't enjoy my time here. Didn't have any opportunity to grow and expand my skills and knowhow. No support from management to get better at your job and contribute to new and innovative ways. Out of all the companies ive worked at nvidia has a place place for me.  The company is doing amazing things in the tech space and it was an exciting thing to be part of it Nvidia offers a very fast paced dynamic work environment. I enjoyed working there on latest technologies. Being a Program Manager, I had to work with a geographically diverse development and QA teams. Learned lot of new technologies from Nvidia like SCCM, office 365 migration etc. developed troubleshooting skills. very good environment to work. Thanks Loved this place, company culture is a bit dilute compared to the good old days (2009 lots of nepotism) but still a great place to work today. Moving more toward a general corporate culture, but if you're interested in a company that allows you to grow while enjoying high levels of professionalism they are for you.
