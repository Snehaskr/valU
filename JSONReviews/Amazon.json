"content":"An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Steady work, management is great! The only problem is standing for long hours, but that's normal at a job. It's a great way to have a second income, and picking your schedule could fit with your daily life as well! i loved it  just like any other  job you just need a break. i didnt like that waslk time was included in your break. Time off task is a biggie and will still effect you if machines go down or work load is low. Never had a problem working the seasonal positions. They are accommodating, safe, employees are very easy to work with and a great company to work for. Started part-time as a temporary job. The biggest issue that most people would have would be the hours which is from midnight till the morning. You get training for the roles though most of the time you'll get put in a position that they deem you most efficient which could get a bit tedious. Still the work is physical which helps in keeping you awake. Enjoyed the company of coworkers and management were pretty nice in my experience and were always willing to help out new workers. It's for the young. Many older folks can't take the pace. You are expected to produce. I've seen many people fired because they couldn't keep up. You are trained by other workers. If you hit your numbers, they just raise them the next time around pushing for more. They project a relaxed culture but that is only if the always increasing production/processing numbers are hit. Amazon was ok as a picker, but it wasn't for me. If you want to lose weight, this is the job for you. Constant walking. Reward for staying over when everyone else has left. Please make sure that you are at you position after break. Good place to work..very time manageable. Have to be able to keep up with the pace.Great overtime and hours! Especially during peak season! Great pay. not many people take a warehouse job as their first job. I was the youngest one there. I worked nights and everyone was pretty nice except the people they outsourced, they were terrible. The management for Amazon is usually a recent college graduate. This is their first real job and it shows. The turnover rate for these roles are very high. They stress you out with manager rating and the pretense of stock options you will never get due to most of them not making it to year 2. Then you deal with the pressure the manager feels as a tier 1 or 3 as they are stressed and overworked staying at the FC for 14 hours. Not the culture I want to be associated with.  I was lured into the opportunity with the generous signing bonus and stock options.  After becoming more entrenched in the culture, I saw the true face of Amazon which i did not want to be a part of. Very easy to get the position, lots of competition for the available work. Too many people have signed up at this point and the market is over-saturated. Loved this job and would recommend to others. Great way for college students to begin there journey into the real worl. Amazon provides multiple areas of Emily for all With every shipment that comes in you are met with a couple challenges, for instance you have to know what area the package is going to, keep the conveyance moving at all times. All while making sure that bar-codes stay facing upright as the packages move along. This is also while training 2-5 new associates in this particular job function. The work day at Amazon is slow  and tiring, they do not give us any room to move to a different job title. They say they give you two 15 min but if you are in the very back and top of the building its more like an 8 min break. The pay raise they gave us was 15 dollars an hour but living expenses here are to high to be able to pay rent and live on your own. Great placeGreat hoursGreat payGreat benefits Overall great staffi had a great time working therei just wish their HR was a bit more organized when it comes to helping employees with medical related issues As whiny as it sounds apparently I have to make a review but working at an Amazon Warehouse during Black Friday and Christmas was a difficult experience for me, mandatory overtime, constantly on your feet for 10 hours a day, and working overnight shift melted together wasn't fun. Over night shift, small group great people to work with, everyone is willing to help each other out  to get the job done. Manger are ok depending on who’s working that night but don’t expect them to get up and help. With exception of one and she rocks! RL...... Great place to work as long as your managers see that you are exceeding productivity rates that they will change on a daily basis, all while trying to lower man hours so others have to work harder. Working at amazon was a challenging job, as far as dealing with meeting their expected rates . But amazon was a good job to work at because they had an fair pay rate, and benefits. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Amazon is a great and loving company to work for. I really enjoyed working for this company. Amazing benefits, awesome management, great co-workers, and even better compensation and opportunities .The performance metrics can be a little unsettling; but otherwise a good place to work. Overall it was a good place to work. It was extremely fast paced and competetive but the lack of ability to advance in a career there made it not for me im the end. a day working at amazon is very fast paced. but its an okay job. if your driving for them its mostly the traffic that gets to you. other than that if i can i will go back I learned how to manage by being organized so things don’t get out of control,I also focused on sending out merchandise on time so costumers will be happy I worked there and i would not go back. I learned that the amazon i worked at was more for young people.some of the management were for the company and not the worker. I did not feel valued for my hard work. I felt passed over for advancement because of my age. The work is very physically demanding.  I got a hernia and a torn tendon. It was a fun place to work at. Meet fun new people and it keeps you busy. Hours are tiring but its great pay. I would most definitely work there again. no work life balance, repetitive and mundane work. not really any upward mobility unless you have technical experience or software skills or are willing to relocate No work life balance in fulfillment fast paced and long hourswork was satisfying and at times funpeak season was high energy lot of good people good experience Amazon in my personal experience is something of an institution that can forge people into better leaders. You are in constant proximity of very smart and intelligent people, you can grow and learn exponentially. You need a tough skin to work with and around less than favorable leaders, hinting at the leadership principles can open up many doors. Complacency is not accepted at most locations, this is not a place to go in and become stagnant. You come in , work very hard, push yourself and others mentally and physically more so and go home feeling content, exhausted, pleased, or defeated. These opportunities allow you to improve and grow to move up or move onto another place of business, or go into business for yourself. Whenever you work at Amazon, you work ten hour days for a minimum of forty hours per week. There's a morning shift and a night shift. You pick any four consecutive days of the week you wish to work. If you have both weekend days in your schedule, you get a fifty cent bonus. You also get a fifty cent bonus if you work night shift.During what we call 'peak' you have mandatory overtime which causes you to work about sixty hours in the week. This job is very physical. The management is decent but there is still quite a bit of confusion going around. You don't really feel like you matter because they just go through employees. Very hire/fire constantly. You don't get much time to yourself. Three days off is great but you just usually catch up on the sleep that you didn't get in the work week. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the physical strain. The best part of the job is the dress code freedom. They allow tattoos, piercings, hair dyes, etc. I like what I do as a receiving clerk. Scanning inbound products. My job is easy. My work site is great. My managers are great. Overall a good experience. I was let go due to a miscommunication as to when my start date was. (I had started a week earlier than originally planned, and was fired due to not showing up to the formerly scheduled orientation date.) There is no way to talk to HR in person unless you are currently employed and onsite. Management never seemed to agree on the correct way to do things. The trainers are brand new employees themselves. This leads to incorrect information being given on how to properly do the job. Lastly they have unrealistically high expectations. I would not recommend. okc5 is not your average place. they are laid back and ready to have a blast but still responsible & driven to be the best, because they are the best! ok as a stepping stone, but they don't see talented employees while they are working there. I had IT experience and just went and left and became network engineer with another company instead of working for amazon. i think outside of the box and could have been key network engineer for amazon, but hey your loss. Good company high demands.  Good people.  Very smart and talented work force with good attitudes.  Most leaders are fair and balanced.  Some will place unreasonable demands Low stress and easy going work place environment. Work is not physically demanding on a person's body. There is a positive attitude from management to employees. Get ready in the morning pickup the packages.I learned to work fast and efficient.Workplace culture is great because i meet different nationalitiesEnjoy freedom, ejoy the streets. High paced environment where you're not always empowered to do the right thing, only the politically correct that has negative repercussions on the company and associates. If you lack a moral standing then it's a high paced enviroment with stock incitive I was very pleased with the system they created for the 'start of the day actions'. *Multiple time clocks to accommodate the many employees starting at the same time, *Pre-warmup to exercise the body before the shift and station assignments, *Company info and updates per department announced at this time. Good system considering the number of associates. Most managers were in training or fairly new to being responsible over people and departments so the interaction was very little and the high concentration was on the computer results/data, which didn't make you feel appreciated at times. All types of injuries are commonplace for most of the repetitive task that requires a tack time productivity scale.BAD Break times An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Fast paced, fun, friendly environment. I enjoyed working here. Management doesn't really do much but walk around and observe, A little more motivation would be nice. its was a lot of walking but good exercise i enjoyed working and meeting new people there i had a lot of fun working there to and some times you got to win things there to Good place to build leadership experience.  Culture is different building to building and region to region.  This will significantly impact career trajectory. face paced good benefits, hard labor on your feet for majority of the day so can get very tiring. enjoyed the management and being able to daily meet new people. As well enjoyed the benefits and incentives that would be given. A typical day at work (amazon) was okay, it really just depended on the day and who was on as manger that day/night. Everyone does there work differently with whoever is on as manger. Usually treat you like a pokemon card in retro-spec when you're trained in multiple areas. 'Hey I need so and so to fill a pack spot because employee B is too slow/or left early'. Managers care and try their best to help on day to days. Takes a couple years to advance and pay isn't all too compensating. Tier system is okay for pay increase, but here in CA need a bit more for cost of living. Great first job or management job if you qualify. Salary + stocks every 6 months for managers is a no brain-er. If you're fresh out of high school, they will whip you into the working worlds shape, (literally you will lose weight!). Benefits are really good, they need to be so when they break you, you wont spend a dime to come back to work for them soon after. This position had good pay and fun environment to work. Management team are very dedicated in helping employees.I enjoy working there and miss working there. Amazon is a good company that has many benefits and can be flexible. Employee break room has options for food to include refrigerators for any food you bring in. If you can handle the long hours, it can be a good experience. Company isn't employee friendly. I worked for them for just over a year, never late, never absent until recently because of a hospital visit. Terminated the next day. Rough and tough non stop job, the packaging area is the absolute worst area in the entire facility. Very poor management, ultra high expectations... They want you too keep going higher and higher, only care about numbers. Managers straight out of college have no idea what the job actually entitles or how it is to actually do the job... They always get on your case for low numbers... Usually the people are nice and fun but that doesn't matter when you have poor management and when you know the corporation really doesn't care for you... The packaging area also has the highest turnover rate possibly in the state than any other place, hmm I wonder why... gl to everyone who joins their team If the consumers and prime members really KNEW how Amazon employees were treated I think they would boycott. You will never advance here unless you are a single parent (woman) with 2+ kids because they know you will take the low paying money amd it will boost your self esteem that you have a leaders role. The people that they select as P.A.’s lack leadership and people skills. But hey what do you expect when the company competitive pay is $2 more than working at Papa Johns. the days went long because you have to stand in one spot for 10 hours. but if you have good knees and a strong back i recommend working here. my co workers where typically nice people. i enjoyed working 4 days and having 3 days off Sometimes free lunch..Good people like friendlyThey have overtime They have good benefits They have safety classThey have locker for your stuffThey have flat screen on break room...they have soda machine and many more..... great benefits, quick paced, friendly environment, on site injury care, very diverse, management sucks, no phones allowed, repetitive work, plenty of walking and excercise Not a bad place to work and the bonus program made it even better. the peak season was bearable due to the music and activities. Cons- extremely long days and only a 30 min break for working 10 hr days amazon was an fast and productive workplace. security was strict entering and exiting the building. it was a challenging pack and ship  customers order Lifting an average of 28 pound boxes all daySorting products into totesMoving product around using pallet jacks2 ten minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch Amazon is an incredibly fast pace company which is extremely results driven. All results are measured by metrics to include moral for everyone from hourly associates to general managers. There is always a 'flavor of the day' with what needs to be focused on constantly changing (i.e. safety, quality, productivity, etc.) Nearly everyone is a type A personality trying to get a head and prove that they and their team are better in the 'spirit of friendly competition' however, this quickly turns into a you vs me situation with both sides trying to show how bad the other side is doing. There is no work life balance especially during the 'peak season' where it is not uncommon to work 6 days a week for more than 11 hours a day as a manager. I honestly didn’t very long in this job it felt like we were being worked way too hard, we had to reach a certain quota every night it was very competitive. everyone was nice and kind and friendly I would say they were all about helping one and another team work was all about with them if you cant make it to work people would cover your shift An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. If you can get up early and provide a quiet home office, it's super easy. There's no script, you have the ability to make decisions without constant approval, and there's resources for how to navigate specific problems - if you need them. If you have a disability they will hire you I worked with  a death young lady and a visually impaired young lady both hard workerss.but that ware house has lots of safety hazards for  example there are bags used to put the products and a lot of times the extra bags are all over the floor easy to trip over and the lighting in this warehouse is horrible if you have perfect vision you probably wonr after working there also it is definetly hard labour. They work on a point system and it is very easy to accumulate points which lead to write ups etc. Amazon is a good place to supplement your income . The port. richmond warehouse in philadelphia is very very busy. Most of The managers dont get their hands dirty.most of the ambassadoes are in cliques.they allow certain employees to stand around and chit chat.be on their phone etc while other employees are busting their hump.For the most part all the co workers are nice and helpful. Fast paced fun environment, competitive and challenging . Learn multiple skills and teamwork. Many different personalities to interact with which makes work more enjoyable Amazon is an extremely competitive and political environment. There are a lot of opportunities to work on incredible and exciting things, but the competition to do the most interesting work and to advance your career is fierce. Amazon's own internal competition between both business groups and individuals undermines the company's 'leadership principals'. The promotion process is so politically driven that people spend more time jockeying for position than thinking about real, long term solutions to scale. If you want to advance, you have to burn brighter than the rest- but be careful, it can take a long time to ascend to higher levels in the company and it is difficult to sustain that kind of performance without faltering. If you falter, others will strike at the opportunity to highlight your weakness. It is often easier to leave the company and come back at a higher level after a year or so, than to get promoted, even if you are a 'top tier' performer. If you are employed in an Amazon warehouse avoid injury at all cost. Amazon doesn't care about you and your health plus dealing with lack of communication between a whole bunch of third parties. Amazon had its ups and.its downs like any other job I worked in Induction-Inbound Recieving unloading Trucks,Airfreight, emptying Gaylords,Scanning,Etc Amazon was an amazing job, I just had a lot of unforeseen circumstances to come up during my time at amazon and that is why i had to depart from Amazon. Ultimately i would recommend this job to anyone. You can determine your success. Customers are the number one priority and continuously looking for process improvement. Great pay and benefits. Employees safety and job satisfaction was always a top management concern. Good working conditions, but not wasting resources on things that don't benefit the customer experience. Excellent use of technology to manage performance. I love working for Amazon. It challenges you and sometimes it can feel overwhelming but at the end, you feel accomplished. It was a lot of data entry for the position that I'm in. It's all about the customer and being a customer myself that's good to know. Loved this place, just couldnt fit it into my lifestyle at the time with a newborn baby, had to make an important decision to leave one of my dream jobs. I have nothing really good to say.  We were overworked, made to work overtime, instead of asked to work it.  It felt like I was only home to sleep and eat, then rite back into the sweatshop. sorta out mail packagesscanning mail / packagesuploading and packing the hardest part of this job was lift up boxes and big bags you couldnt leave if your job was done The job has a lot of perks, but it can be stressful depending on how many hours they need you to work. It can easily get tedious and tiring. Very rewarding for those that can get passed that. More benefits within the company should be there being as though the company is so huge . Although all in all I really enjoyed working with the management team . The best part of working at Amazon is the people. Learned a lot about logistics and priority management. Very competitive environment. Opportunities and learning abound in every direction. Never know what role you will be put into next. Ever changing environment with the stability of remedial tasks throughout. If you really want to work in delivery, Amazon isn't a great idea. They'll keep you on and work you ragged for like a month before they stop calling you in for work. They're equipment is broken and the management doesn't really care about your well being. Amazon has good benefits but the hours are long and you have a new manager every couple of months. It's so hard to keep track of who's your manager. Working 11-hour shifts takes a toll on your body. You have to meet the rate of 100% or you get written up. After 3 write-ups they fire you. This job is very fast paced and is not for the faint of heart. Good place to start career, workplace is good and busy. People are welcoming and outgoing. Work departments vary on the kind of task required. Benefits are very good and affordable. very supportive of each and focus on improving for the future. Always looked forward to a day at work.  Safety is a key role at amazon and I felt very valued as an intern there Working with this company is good and a workout cause i was a picker but i liked what i was doing cause i came in with my water and workout clothes on ready to work An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Free coffee for employees and a safe place to work Because they have really good security at the gate, they have CCTV cameras everywhere and friendly peoples This was a crazy fast paced job with a wide variety of people that called in on a regular basis.   The job was never boring,  always provided a challenge to provide quick service while keeping the customer on the phone happy.  The best part of the job was when your day was over,  the job was over with no stress to carry over to the next day. I have been working at Amazon full-time (Less than a year)ProsI've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for … ConsNo cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life  balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse. Walking into the Amazon offices it is more on the relaxed side compared to other companies but that doesn't take away from the high work demand. The day generally begins sitting down at your desk and working on the project you have been assigned. In my case I was reviewing and analyzing data from the children's store. This was a weakly task that consisted of a formal data report with an analysis paper ready for Friday meetings. In my opinion the Friday meetings were my least favorite part of the job at first because it was difficult for everybody in the room to agree with one idea. Though this was a struggle in the beginning it truly developed my communication skills and ability to cooperate with peers into what it is today. On the other hand the most enjoyable part about working in the Amazon offices had to be everybody's desire to learn and grow from each other. Amazon is definitely a quick paced and high energy environment. It was challenging, but I loved the opportunity to push myself. All the staff were constantly working to motivate and reward all the employees. It's a stressful job you are overworked and in many cases under paid.If your production rate is not consistent you are 'terminated' from the company. My job there was seasonal but It was a great experience. The other employees were king and my manager was very nice and understanding he was always willing to help. The hours were pretty flexable qll in all I would definitely etly work there again given the chance. Fast pace short hoursThey are all about customer satisfaction and delivery in a timely manner . People are nice and helpful when needed.  It helps for extra income Hours were flexible, customers were cooperative, management responded quickly to any issues I had. Only issue would be that they offered no phone number to call if email was not available. Could not get hours while working on the floor. Therefor was only getting 10-20 hours a week at the end. Poor construction of cooler/freezer. I fell and got hurt 11/2017. Management is the only problem at Amazon as far as I'm concerned. Dishonest, scary. I would come to work on time; never missed, Not happy there, rough Amazon appeared to be a position that was only temporary and not permanent. The supervisors at the Dupont location were not professional and the permanent workers were negative in the work environment. Amazon Robotics is an organizational disaster - a couple of people in the management hierarchy usurped the tops and everyone else haz to suck it up. Corporate HR, please take notice. This job is perfect for you if you are used to a fast paced hard labor environment. The location in St.Louis,MO only offers part time schedules, but “encourages you to work full time hours” with no benefits. You have to scan all packages in before you can leave for the day even if that means working overtime! Everyone is very friendly and you can advance pretty quickly if you are meeting scan rates and numbers.Overall it’s a decent job if this is what you are used to, but wasn’t the job for me. Overall the company is ok, for a part-time experience. Working can be exhausting, must take breaks as requested. Use the discounts that are given to you as an employee. I used to sell on Amazon's Marketplace.  In recent years, many items have been restricted and there are more scammers on there.  No longer a viable way to make income. Hard work decent pay but management treats you like a number. No work life balance possible because of shift times, and no incentive to work harder! Don't recommend as a carrer it was a culture of chewing people up and discarding them like garbage when it fits the company employees with the company more than 5 years were being fired for no reason other than management needed to get rid of them poor management, extreme work conditions, come and go as you please results in harder work environments for others. It is physically exhausting and the shifts are scheduled awkwardly and with terrible hours Working their was fun manager wore cool bdbdbddbbrhxrbhdrbhcbfnebb rhrrbbffbfbfbgbbcrbdhdbbfbfbfbfbfnfnfnfbnnfnffnfnfncjfjfjtnhkkkkkjkmmmnhhgggvvvgggg An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. great workplace secluded work place and helpful staff , graveyard shifts lobby were messy and no place to sit. would like for enviorment to offer more opportunity while on current job. really fast paced, takes a toll on the body. its 1 milloin sq foot  3 story warehouse , you will get a work out .. if you work more than hr away might no be woth it for you to dive home .. very very tired especially during peak holidays 55-60 hrs a week Stow was slow-paced. I learned how to use the scanner they gave us, so that was cool. Honestly, it was also very fast-paced when it needed to be, and competitive if it came to staying after the holiday season. If you enjoy a fast paced team environment, then this is a great job.  I believe it is important that employees are physically healthy. There is a lot of physical stress with the job, especially as a picker; but it is great exercise.  The management is pretty upbeat and they are pro team environment. There is no doubt Amazon is one of the best company to work in your life, all you have to do is you need to land in right team that helps your career growth otherwise you will be stuck and keep on writing multiple page documents. The production  rates they wanted were offensive!  They wanted same rates regardless of your age.  I was 66 and they expected my rate to be as fast as the 20-30 year olds (the typical age of most in that warehouse). The worst job I've ever had in my life. It's like working on a plantation with hundreds of overseers looking over you. A typical day at Amazon is fast paced. I learned to quickly pull orders and manage my time. The hardest thing about working at amazon was standing. The most enjoyable part was the people. Be prepared to be written up if you dont make your numbers I came with a group literally there was nobody left either fired or quit. Short breaks quick lunch they dont trust there own mother camera surveillance and metal detectors everywhere decent pay but kis it worth the exhaustion and body hurt don't think so. Working at Amazon was a 'Carefully Tailored,&Controlled' Experiment! Everything you do is being monitored. They want the productivity to increase at rocket speed in a short period of time . They work you like a mule and throw benefits at you with high deductibles and your job security is terrible. You are replaceable and Its hard to get into other areas unless you know the who. The lunch time is not enough and is rushed. The area is massive by the time you get to the break you've wasted 5 or 10min of your break. Amazon is good ONLINE but working physically for them id not recommend. WASNT WORTH IT. 3 stars..thats me being generous. -Very Competitive-Strenuous-Little or no work life balance-Strict Schedule requirements-Production environment-Stressful-Data Driven……………………... Amazon was alright to work at. I wouldn't say it s the best place to work at. some days were more stressful than others. I made a few friends there which made my work days go by faster and easier. If you can manage 3000 employees and concentrate on 15 tasks at once, this is your company.  They challenge you in every aspect.  From coaching, developing, mentoring, and managing.  Fast pace, lots of room for advancement, long hours, great perks. i did well an would love to work with amazon again. Management made it able to have a smooth work day. I trained more than 200 associates at amazon assured i would be  help to the business. So much walking made me feel 20 years older. Needed new shoes every 2 to 3 months. The repetition of the job gave me tendonitis. Changed mangers every few months. Amazon was like high school. You had people coming to work to make friends, bullying other people, having relationships with someone else’s spouse. It was really crazy. Managers not really being involved in the physical work. Some folks cherry picking. Its an awesome place to work..management is great...get to meet new people on a daily basis...get to do different activities to complete the days goal Starting off it is a very nice place to work i loved it! but then i started to realize that there was a lot of favoritism taking place and workig here while pregnant is terrible but if you can make it the maternity leave is aamazing. Amazon gives you a set amount of PTO and UPT hours and thats all you get as time off there are no exceptions. Would not be a bad job for a young person.  However the work was very physical and long.  The norm is 10 hour days, four days a week with, at times voluntary overtime of 10 hours but at other times mandatory overtime of 10 hours. Easy work, not stressful at all. Good pay for the work. Part time hours are controlled based on the ACA eligibility. Very relaxed work environment and managers are very nice for the most part. If you do the assigned work at a reasonable pace, managers really don't say much to you, but they are a very positive group An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. overworked for less pay. The communication is limited. There's no structure. You working different jobs without the proper training. And there is favortism among the ones who been there. There is no equal oppurtunity there. Long shifts constantly moving and carrying out your duties throughout a maze that stretches thousands of feet’s . Job may become overwhelming to some that may have never been on ones feet for more than three hours straight. Non the least it’s a job that can test the employees a little better .. Amazon could use some fine tuning at ATL6.  They have some of the worst process assistants which need help with how to approach respect and motivate employees.  There are way to many employees which causes flex down only allowing you to work 3 hours for the day which happens a lot so many weeks you can be at 15 total hours of work for five days.  You definitely need to be part of the “favored” group in order to be trained to do something besides scanning.  A vast majority of “favored” employees don’t go to were they are assigned on the daily roster which significantly contributes to preventing cross training.  There is a culture that requires a scan rate above 130 and this culture teaches you can do it but you need to grab a lot of “jiffies”.  This often leave the majority of the large packages untouched and the process assistants will come to male employees telling them to pick up large packages;  it would be better if computer scan rate were changed to factor larger or heavier packages as more than one item in the caculations. Everything is fast pace. they will be on you if they feel like you didn't reach your rate for the day.you do get 3 breaks because of how long the shift Amazon provides a safe, fast-paced warehouse environment with great benefits, and quality leadership. The workplace culture is very diverse, with a relaxed dress code. Working here was a blast. The management was understanding and cared about you as a person. The various positions were easy to learn and had their own perks. Its not set up for success amazon could be much better. If your willing to sacrifice your outside life. And work like a robot this is the job for you. Side note great for a temporary job. Poor management from all managers.Hostile co-workers. Passive aggressive co-workers. Poor attention-to-detail from managers. Not much guidance, if there was any- it wasn't much. I learned that Amazon behind the scenes for 'associates' wasn't thrilling at all. Every workplace will have some kind of pros and cons.It's not as easy to move up. Amazon doesn't just promote you because you are great at what you do. Amazon promotes you if you are able to pass the interview process. As long as you can tell a great story you can get any job within the company and I've seen it at first hand that is not always the best idea to hire someone just because they can tell a great story but by experiences. The Pros is, of course, my associates' great group of people to work with. Scanning the first item at a certain time is so darn stupid.   Even though your production is good, if you get 3 write ups within 90 days because of fast start you’re terminated.  The manager and human resource sucks.  The company will aggravate the he’ll out you about VTO when Xmas season is over.  They also care more about the items then the workers because no security going in, but only going out.  Anyone can walk in with some type of weapon and drugs.  What was the purpose of hiring permanent if you gonna turn around and let people go.  Hire fire hire fire hire fire is their motto. I forgot to mention about the short 2 thirty minutes breaks including loooooong walks.   No I wouldn’t recommend.   No thanks. I started with benefits and decent pay from the first day. The job is very physically demanding and starts to wear on you after a while. They are very strict on taking time off, once you use all of your unpaid time it is an automatic termination, so when i started to have medical issues preventing me from hitting my rate, i started looking for another job. Good money tiring a good job make sure to eat right u need your energy and rest cause it is a job that will tire u put but also help you get fit from all that walking Terrible Evaluation Process.  Only one person holds your destiny in their hands.  Need to have more managers involved in process of evaluation a Level 6 Manager It was quite different from my previous jobs but it felt good doing something else for a change. A good working environment and also lovely staffs and co workers. i would work about 12 hours a day just handing there picking items couldn't listen to music that job was really boring and they work you like salves the management was good I would recommend Amazon to anyone who wants to work there. The management are excellent to work for they are very helpful. The co-workers are very nice to work with I had fun at Amazon. Amazon is a great and loving company to work for. I really enjoyed working for this company. Amazing benefits, awesome management, great co-workers, and even better compensation and opportunities. All around good job. Decent position but pay wasn't great while I worked there about three years ago. I would have continued to work there had the pay been more and had the commute been more reasonable. A typical day at amazon was stressful and exhausting, would not recommend to anybody. I was never excited about going to work. Also they do not give you a decent amount of pto and vacation time. You MUST be ok with fast paced physical labor work, if you are not okay with this then do not bother, especially during peak season! You MUST also be ok with being pushed to do your job.They track how many packages you are doing per minute with your scanner and so if you don’t keep up with their expectations or quotas it is brought to your attention. I wasn’t lazy and I worked hard, I did not have a problem with it because I felt like I was getting a 4 hour work out. I was even told on my second day that I was in the top 4 of all 12 stowers for my shift, cool huh! , but on my 4th day on the job I experienced an area lead that was offended by me asking for help with a heavy box that was marked in neon green the words “heavy” all over it and one of the pickers even warned me about it, I knew he had got offended because afterwards he felt the need to point out every single big and heavy box to me and make sure I did them ASAP, I was responsible for 10 different lanes that shift and would get to them once I hit those lanes but I guess he felt the need to bring them to my attention constantly thru my entire shift, over and over again. I was NOT cherry picking and I was taking care of all bigger boxes before hitting smaller ones and you would think that he would only tell me about areas that were getting over flow but NOPE he made sure to point out every single big heavy box with emphasis that I did them ASAP, causing me to switch lanes over and over. I felt very under appreciated, my dedication and hard work efforts were not put into consideration and I left work that night  feeling horrible. Was Not even told good job or anything... I know how to take constructive criticism and work logically and reasonable, it takes a lot to upset me. This area leads  way of leading me was unprofessional and very obvious that he was singling me out and giving me a hard time ... maybe he felt like I shouldnt have asked him for help and I should have asked my other team member? Idk... I understand that we are supposed to get bigger boxes out of the way first to make room for more and that is exactly what I was doing, there was only one time that made sense that he brought up the big boxes sitting on the side to me because the area was in need of stowing due to overflow and lack of space but all the other times there was plenty of space and no overflow. If what I experienced with him was a taste of what was to come in doing that job task, then I want nothing to do with it! Sadly after that experience I resigned the next day. If you really need a job and can handle the physical aspects and the pushing to do your job , then go ahead and move forward with your employment with them. Unfortunately this is not the right fit for me. Getting hired is easy , at new hire event you may dress casual, get good info, drug test is done by mouth swab, after this.... wait for drug test results and background check and next thing you know your hired and get a start date. First day.... Wear work out clothes ! Bring bottle of water! Or bring change for vending machine. Breaks are only enough time to sit, drink water,  use restroom,  and back to shift. You will sweat, so I recommend NO jeans! Good luck and I hope my long review helps anyone seeking employment here. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. its a good place to work. I enjoyed working with my colleagues each day. we were able to work as a team to get the work done. the manager kept open communication. The company has grown to fast to be able to handle the problems that are come up. All the upper management just keeps putting the problems on the next person. Hard fast paced work, really nice people, plenty of accommodations for employees. Holiday meals provided by management. Food, games, tv's, refrigerators, microwaves, literally everything. Fast paced, high volume warehouse position sorting customer packages for delivery the next day. Volume of packages rose over time adding stress to accomplish our task. This job has to be one of the most poorly managed jobs I have ever been in. I work at least 10 hours straight with no breaks and I have to urinate in a spare cup if I want a bathroom break. If you ever make a mistake then you’d better get ready because the DSP owners will yell at you like you’re a child and make a massive scene in the warehouse. The vans tend to get cigarette butts in them so you’re driving in vans that have been smoked in which isn’t legal either. You run the risk of also getting a stranger’s urine spilled all over you and even then they won’t let you go home and change. They force you to work through it. to sit in solemn silence on a dull dark dock in a pestilential prison with a life long lock, awaiting the sensation of a short sharp shock by a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block something always broke so that messing with the productivity of the day, but other wise then that the job is decent your always busy, always moving. The pay is good & depending on the facticity you either get 2 30 minute breaks or two 15 minute breaks. very fast pace environment, Pay and benefits are alright. Not very understanding to you becoming sick so if you need to call out make sure to send your doctors note right away. terrible work culture and environment survival of the who's willing to slit throats and murder to get to the top. boring, mundane, autopilot. all day everyday. all the losers with no experience fresh out of college will lie and steal the ideas of all the other managers with actual work experience. prepare to have someone steal the credit for your ideas and hard work and then have the audacity to try and reprimand you at the same time. :) They pride themselves on taking care of their employees. They are very fair with their benefits and the management is very friendly and willing to help. It's a fast paced workplace but it has so many benefits that make it a good opportunity for people to have a secure job. And also there is a chance to raise your salary after 6 months. This job is horrible. Standing in one spot all 10 hours working like your a robot. God forbid you go to the bathroom the manager will come talk to you because you had time off task. We are treated like machines and not people. its draining. they gonna watch your time even your going to the bathroom they have rates that you need to be work on. phone signal is kinda hard to get sometimes you need to go outside. I applied for a position at the amazon warehouse in Tucson Arizona, I was drug tested and background checked and passed with flying colors I was promised a job. I waited for 4 weeks to receive a notice of when my first day would be and they told me they had made a mistake and over hired people for the warehouse. At the time I was down on my luck trying to make ends meet and they basically told me sorry cant hire you until further notice. DO NOT APPLY TRUST ME SAVE YOUR TIME Don't waste your time with part-time seasonal.  After the two week training, there's no work for you.  You're in their system but no work schedule.  Waste of my time,  they don't train you you train yourself and other co-workers are helpful when you ask them questions but they have rates to keep up with so don't bother them to much.  The work is heavy picking up cases of water, drinks to stow.  I learned not to work  there again. it was my first job and it was honestly very easy. people there are nice literally everyone was nice. had a blast. sometimes would get overwhelmed due to how things work there and depending on the time of year but an overall great place to work. I enjoyed the benefits and pretty much everything about the job. I like how the atmosphere was laid back and relaxed and a very upbeat and positive place to work Climbing laddersNot enough trainingManager lied about trainingWalking 10 hours on concrete/including climbing ladders to stor Workplace Culture was great with co-workers who complained about the same things. Lovely work environment but metamessages are often portrait within  management. It could be easy to get thrown under the bus if one is not careful. Love the work environment and compensation. The hours, schedule or employees finances are not handled by management but by HR which is a big plus. The flow in management varies from the department to department. Some are a dream come true while others are questionable. Work is competitive yet relaxed. You have one objective, to get your work done and then you go home at the end of your shift. Everyone there at the Fulfillment center was super friendly, ready to train you for any additional job tasks. They make sure you are ready for the tasks they will provide before giving out the task to you. Management makes it an awesome place to work for, they try their best to put a smile on your face. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. I have no comment at this time. Amazon is a growing company with a huge upside. Life work balance is good for a 4 day work week but the hours are long and hard in the warehouse. Employees nor managers last long here. Long hours on your feet. Not much room to grow. And if you try you better be prepared to work your butt off. You need points to move up. So if you want to move up learn as many different things as you can.  But I'm told they do have great benefits (I opt out) Great compensation, good work life balance, challenging culture, but limited career growth options for people in non software or hardware engineering roles. friendly and structure environment move up fast in company if you have the willingness to learn new things jobs maybe be easy others hard but you can always transfer to other departments and be cross trained and help build your resume. All the workers are very helpful and very nice. They make the work day go by fast. The Ambassador's are very friendly and willing to help at anytime. Water coolers are provided throughout the building as well as vending machines located in the break room. When i was there it was 12 an hour. The bosses stood with their watches ' tagging ' those who were late, even if was a minute. At the current pay rate(15.00), im sure they even more 'choosy' Overall its a nice first job for anybody who is looking for part time, full time or just looking to do something in their free time.if you need the money definitely give it a chance. Typical day at Amazon is you are always moving around, it is a fast pace job. I like to learn new things, so in a few weeks I learned quite a lot different parts of the job. My typical day at work is roll call and receiving information. Management was not easy to talk to about issues or problems and were not always available. The job was not complicated at all. The most enjoyable part was being recognized and rewarded when you though no one noticed. Overall, it was an ok place to work for. Good benefits and rewards. I don't understand how all of the rules are stressed for the level 1 associates are not followed by the management. I see why it's such High turnover. I can respect a person with a military background like my father has but I don't understand the tyrannical behavior practiced by a supervisor at my location. He talks to people like he is trying to belittle them & embarrass them in front of the rest of the team. The company is very good place to work, with adequate equipment and tools to perform the job. The management is try but should improve on skill advancement for skilled workers to be engaged in their skill development. You will never get a hold of the HR department. They do not answer phones. The managers will tell you you're not allowed to do something but 'can you read between the lines'. The pace is a joke, the breaks aren't long enough to even use the restroom. I only worked there for a week.  The company is a good company to work for but I changed to another company to work because of the hours. I would recommend it to another person. You just need to know which locations to work at.  Sort centers are only part time and MUCH better than fulfillment centers.  You get the same pay for less strenuous work and more flexible schedules.  The environment in my location is very relaxed.  We are encouraged to have fun daily and are included in various activities and are often given snacks, drinks, etc.  Most people have great personalities and make you look forward to coming into work every day.  Also, sort centers hours 'flex' up or down (0 mins to 1 hr) based on the volume of packages.  If we flex down for a shift or multiple shift and our hours turn out to be less than we were scheduled, if we show up for every one of our shifts we get guaranteed pay for the hours we were scheduled but didn't make due to volume. temporally my work is scanner  check the line ballet jack. trabajamos en equipo para sacar la mercancia a tiempo porque la compania lo require pero es un trabajo muy Bueno y divertido 10 hours is a long time on your feet everyday, breaks are not long enough, lunch is not long enough, productivity is not easy to make every single week. I liked it, but call center Work ain’t for everyone. No idea why there is a 160 character minimum for a review. My team lead was good, a little bit harsh with coaching for calls at times. Fulfillment Centers work environments are different from Prime Now Centers. In Fulfillment Centers you need to learn 'a' task with the option to learn more (smile) if you want. Do your task fairly well and management won't talk to you. Big 'factory' mindset.In Prime Now Centers, you must learn the entire process - from vendor to customer as part of the team. The atmosphere is like a small local retail store - everyone must pitch in. The job was easy enough, but management made it harder. Requirements that shouldn't exist do, and work flow that should exist gets thrown out due to incompetent managers, and co-workers. If you have any work ethic at all, this is not the job for you; you will be over worked, and stuck watching everyone else walk around and talk, when you stop to go to the bathroom, you will get yelled at for not working, because the entire company runs on people like you... the 5%. Promotions at Amazon have nothing to do with how well of a worker you are, but in how well you can answer a few unrelated questions, and to even get that far, it is all about being 'buddy buddy' with you area manager. When I try and get a job off there site it just a waist of time it always says uh oh so I try again and again I'm up from 5am till night trying to get in so I just stop trying they try and make there selves look good but it's no jobs and if it is all the way in jefferson ga, that is a far ride almost 3 hours away from where I'm located that's just not cool. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. The management was very poor and practically acted like kings/queens of the warehouses. The pay is alright for when you start out but when they start making you do other people's job for the same pay is when the value of the job diminishes. Amazon was a great place to work. I plan on going back as soon as possible. Always a great encouragement level from management. Very warm inviting atmosphere. Encourages employees to be forward thinking and initiative. I enjoyed working there pay good good hours and they provide transportation only problem is u got to be fast cause if not your number will be low and that cause problems for you A+ Great place to work, plenty of work, fast paced environment, management seemed to want to keep people down not elevate, workplace culture on 1st shift was great 3rd shift was horrible This job is great. Lots of opportunities to move up. Lots of benefits. This job is NOT for lazy people. Lots of people that complain about the job are lazy and expect to get paid to do nothing. It's a job. You're supposed to do work. If you can't handle a very physical job, then this job isn't for you. ok job nice benefits long work hours. Peak season is a nightmare. to many people too much taffic. Other than that it was cool. They just raised the pay so it will make it worth it now. Didn't work for Amazon long, its ok very fast paced. Had to quit due to moving. The managers I worked with are very caring and were helpful if you had a issue. A typical day at Amazon is when you arrive you head over to the stand up area where management will assign you a station to pick or pack at. Depending on how good you are with the manager you will placed in a spot that you want to be in instead of somewhere you are needed to be in... Favoritism plays a huge role here between Managers and Associates. If you want to move up in the company, it seems like you have to be a favorite of management. You would think hard work pays off but in this case it doesn't. I suffered two long years at this company with the intent of moving up. No matter how hard I worked to progress my career with this company, in the end it didn't matter because management had their favorites that they wanted to move up. I would NOT recommend anyone to work here. I worked at a fulfilment center for a year starting as a seasonal worker during peak. From my experience the amount of work isn't worth the money. They barely give out any time off (80 hours unpaid, 48 hours paid per year) and management barely has any care for any tier 1 associates. I wouldn't recommend working here at all. I felt like I was joining a cult. No one there seemed to realized how poorly they were being treated. Everything you do is tracked... Everything. You are told that you can stop working to stretch, drink some water, or go to the bathroom. But the clock that is tracking your progress continues no matter what you're doing. They toss around the 'fired' word a lot. Anecdotal stories of people being fired for dropping something under a powered down conveyor belt and picking it up without having a tech pick it up. You will work  hard from the time you clock on until the time you clock off. There is zero downtime. Turnover is so high there that my manager had only been there for a couple of years. You will not feel trusted, you will not feel respected, and you will not feel like your job is secure. In this work space, either you got the job done. Or it will be done by others. The company has great benefits health wise, and holds a conpetitive environment. Overall the cleanest of work spaces i have been in for labor work (warehouse wise) i want to work anyhow and i love to work and i saw many people who loved their amazon work so i want to work in amazon i want to try something new and learn new things they treat you as a robot, they don't give the the extra break that they have to give you when you work 10 hours, I just didn't like, because for them you just a number a typical day is long and fast paced, tiring. and great experience making sure that Amazon customers get the packages, and that they enjoy the customer experience Job is cool, but under paid for sure. I love the company as we are one of the biggest in the world. Management in staffing is very poor. Some of the managers do not even have a degree which makes it a little disheartening to say the least... Lots of turnover within management creates job-related stress.  Company focuses on change for the sake of change.  Seattle frequently doesn't really understand what's going on in Indiana. I work for Amazon Prime Shopper and have learned for to do shipping begs, but not many hours poor management asking to get hours either you won't get the problem solved or keep trying laid back job can be festering  because you can't find what the customer order. but shopping can be fun. i hate amazon.i will never work for amazon. they dont care about your health, your just a number there, they always tell you your replaceable bad work environment management focus on employees personal lives versus keeping goals and company deadlines.  Too hard to move up especially when management feels you can do there jobs better than they can. Amazon offered me a lot of development opportunities, but getting promoted is usually hard as they only have a few positions available.  The work environment and management is amazing, and you can definitely learn a lot working here. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. I would get to the workplace around 6:50 am and load my van. Then I would wait until 8:00 to leave and start delivering packages. I got two fifteenth minute breaks and one thirty minute lunch.  I would be back to the warehouse around five everyday. overall it was a great experience to have worked for fedex.I also learned about the company on how it works to get the packages sent out to the customers. Over all fast paced, 100% level is hard to achieve and keep once you make the mark. If you don't achieve the mark, you will be terminated after 3-4 weeks It's easy money and keeps you busy. However the managerial staff does not care about your safety or well being. They care more about your scan rate than the people creating the awesome scan rates. Amazon Associates is a nice place to work and they make the job easier with how the system functions and how easy it is to obtain certain links for certain products. worked my butt off constantly everyday and didnt get good job security. have to pretty much be like flash to hit the numbers they want you to hit picking. On a typical day I would either do the three roles. I could be a person who makes sure that the packages that come down the conveyor belt have the address labeled up, I could be a diverter who takes packages off conveyor belt and puts it in aisle number order onto carts, lastly is a sorter which takes the packages off carts and puts in my bag order. ie. 13.1.5. Amazon warehouse associate treats you like a machine, not a person.  the most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers they make it so much fun working there.  The warehouse is always and I mean always hot and sometimes you get those days where whoops sorry guys I put on the heater so you are literally baking in the warehouse. ​Assist customers via phone, email, chat. ● Utilize a variety of software tools to navigate customer accounts  ● Research and review policies and communicate effective solutions in a timely and professional manner ● Empathize and prioritize customer needs ● Navigate around the internet, using multiple browsers and tabs, and instant messenger tools  ● Would never go back. I gained 30lbs and nearly had a stroke while working there due to the stress and terrible schedule. Good thing I had great insurance if I needed to go to the hospital due to work. Consistent training to keep you up to par with your responsibilities.  Great group of people. Alot of positive activities,  employee appreciation,  good culture. I'm new at this company and i love it its a fast pace job and very physical. So far management have been amazing with me and they answer all my question can't wait to see how many pounds i can loose in the long run, A great company and  very upbeat for team work. The managers keeps the team energize when under pressure. Of course there will be ups and downs but what company does not have that. Very fast paced environment. It is very physical demanding. You are on your feet moving around all day. You have to be in great shape to work there.Overall positive atmosphere to work in. I enjoyed my co-workers at Amazon.  The Christmas holiday was a super busy season but other than that, it was busy.  They work 24/7 including all holidays. Amazon was a well paying job that I enjoyed. But I had to travel so I had to leave the job but the work conditions was good. I learned  lot of dispatch skills that they trained me on. very fast paced job very self efficient job you do most things there by your self if you have any questions that is when you call a manager or get help. scanned and loaded packages to pallet for transporting. would recommend.hardest part was unexpected overtime. meeting new people was a plus.worked well with others Fun place to work. Great benefits and family atmosphere. There is the daily use of heavy equipment and safety equipment. Superviser is friendly and personable. Fast paced job working to get orders processed shipped out to customers. During peak there is alot of overtime. I've worked night shift for almost four year's. I just recently switched to days. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Don't do it i would not do it again. Did not like, the hours, the management or co-workers. Amazon over worked you and it seems like a slave place. I wish I would have never life FedEX it was okay job, no advancement and no suck days. not the best but as a student good enough for me and my situation with also going to school and working. Great mission concept but was not practiced at my location.  Many great ideas that were not carried through.  Very negative leadership and was unwilling to work with employees. Our facility is essentially for unloading packages from the semis and sorting them into delivery bags. Fortunately we aren't touching any products, just boxes and envelopes. On a typical night shift we could have 60 people unloading 25,000 packages from 4 trucks and putting them into 2000 bags between 11:30 and 5:00. After 5:00am another crew loads the bags into the delivery vehicles.The biggest problem is the distribution of labor. Some areas get swamped, and there is no plan to alleviate backups. Example: today several people removing boxes from a conveyor belt went on break, and there was no one assigned to replace any of them for almost a half-hour. So the packages (still flowing down the belt) accumulated at the end and fell onto the floor as other workers scrambled to pick them up.The ambassadors (floor leaders) are expected to redistribute the workers as needed, but it is usually a disorganized, last-minute futile effort. They can only do so much.I love going to work every night because the employees are all good to each other and have each others' backs. But there is only so much you can do before you're overwhelmed. The managers are also great, but their hands are tied as far as labor-hours are concerned. Spent 2 yrs there and it was ciaos from day one. This company will risk your safety or others safety just to ' get it done'. Useless meetings sounds like a train no training. decent job but very boring and cut thoart. overall not worth it. lunch and breaks go by so fast, annoying leaders and workers you have to deal with all day why you forcing us to fill these out. this is ridiculous. that job was terrible. treat you not like a human. i would never go back. final line. bad job. You should be hard working and energetic because they have long working hours with non stop moving. Wish they pay the lunch break since they have really very shory breaks for a long period of time working per day. Plus since there is quota for your quarterly rating you cant even leave work and go to the restroom. Underpaid For A lot of work and rates would not recommend this job to anyone, hard to move up in company unless you know someone or you kiss butt and I The company is stimulating to work at and gives you many chances to advance. The work hours often are a lot so for salary employees you may not make as much per hour based on job responsibilities and duties. A typical day was okay, depending on who was your manager. I learn how to properly train employees, how to fix troubled shipments, and I learned how to open a new building. Management was good. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The enjoyable part of the job was going out of state to open a new building. The company Amazon is cool, its management that is giving them a poor reputation. I was excited about the opportunity, but now I just go to work to get my part over with. I'm ok with the production, but it balances not be a hardship on your employees. Management is what's causing the revolving door. Been working here for 3 days. On my first day no one was there to let me in I had to figure things out on my own. So whatever that email says about being greeted by an amazon worker they should rewrite that and say figure that out on your own. The training was horrible that lasted for about 30 minutes. Which wasn’t even on the job training more like common sense safety training. So make sure you watch those online new orientation videos because that training was more successful than your actual training. Second since the training is terrible you have to figure everything out in your own. It’s not rocket science but I’ve never worked at a place where you just follow what everyone else is doing. Which by the way the poeple there are mute they don’t speak which is super awkward. Also they have no sense of direction you just walk around acting like you’re busy doing god who knows what? They also don’t know you by name. They Have these meaningless stretches to make it seem like the managers actually care about their employees and ask about safety tips when in actuality all they care about is getting those shipments out to fulfill their credibility. They don’t actually care about you guys they walk around in their carts on their high horse the women managers are unapproachable they always look mad looks like they hate the place. When it’s time to bring the carts out to the drivers it’s just a big whole mess they have no system or organization how to bring carts out you just bring them out. Workers just stand there like idiots waiting to bring carts in and out and of course you have  lazy ones who don’t do anything at all, which brings me to favoritism they seem to always have the overweight people just stand there and scan all day long they don’t do any hard labor they stand around and and tell people what to do. This job needs a lot of organization and maybe should bring one of your corporate people to secretly see how things are being run. The time of my employment at Amazon proved that Amazon's Warehouse had been a rather interesting place to work with the conditions, the Drivers to the Lane Assignments and the Packages changing daily. I am currently on work comp and due to quota because managers will tell you different things one will tell u 2 worry about quality another about quota Flexible management, good benefits, advancement opportunities. As an upcoming graduate I've found their support towards students very useful as well.  I worked in a Customer Service call center. You would think that a company with this kind of money and growth would be like working with a Google.com, think again. Every working day something went worse. Money decent, hours horrible. Does not matter the position you work, it will not be consistent work-flow. Upper management, or those who never stepped foot in facility make frequent, unwarranted changes that don't seem to benefit customer, AMZN, or DSP staff. good organization at work and good comunication with costumers A typical day started at 1 am and ended at 8 am. Once you walked through those doors you didn't have a break until you left with constantly moving to Sort packages i love working there i wish i can go back i want to go back so bad..  they dont have one in alabama. I love   the people and i love my boss and  they accept as we are deaf An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Working at Amazon has given me the opportunity to balance my life/work as well as to go further into employment into my desired career. I am looking forward to more opportunities Amazon has to offer. Working in a fulfillment center is the polar opposite of working at Amazon Corporate in Seattle.  Even though the salary is increasing to $15 an hour it is hardly enough for the cost of living and the job is designed for someone under 21 who is living at home and just needs some extra 'pocket money'I am an associate in the Fresh fulfillment warehouse.  This is only food in Ambient & Chilled.  The job itself is only 5 hours a day and is a breeze and easy compared to working in a regular Amazon fulfillment center for 10 hours where you are working with all types of general merchandise. The job is only part time with no advancement opportunities.  As a part time worker you get no benefits (except for a discount of $100 per calendar year from Amazon.com), only 20 hours are allowed as unpaid time off, if you exceed that number for any reason you get terminated.  Your shift & hours are locked in, you cannot change the hours or days you are scheduled.There is virtually no training, especially training on how to work efficiently to maintain the required rate you need to pick items as a Fresh associate The rate at which you pick items determines whether you will be coming back to work the next day or if you will be terminated as many previous reviews have alluded to. Amazon has a figure it out as you go culture which sets you up for failure! The lack of training and development is ridiculous. a typical work day is me working 16 hours a day, no break! Workloads are always unmanageable. Since churn is so high, hours are always in flux to cover personnel gaps. The strong bias for MBAs, hampers one's ability to rise in the ranks on the Retail side of the business. The hours are good but you do a lot of walking, your body is going to hurt for the first 2-3 weeks, you meet some good people their. It's just very tiring and in the summer theres not air and in the winter theres no heat. Intense and Fun place to work. Enjoyable experience with solid mechanisms to grow.Intense and Fun place to work.leadership principles are ket to the company's success and alignment on company goals is critical for the individual's success. Job is for a younger person.  If you managed to stay there long enough, you know the system, if not...too bad. Favoritism was evident after a couple of days on the job. Minimal training then your thrown to the wolves. Amazon is the worst job I have ever had. Management has no people skills or experience dealing with people.  You work hard and are forced to work overtime when ever they want you to. It was a great place to work, they really care about their employees. I would definitely work there again.The pay and the benefits were great. The environment was great as well. When I started November 2017 poor training had to fend for myself about answers to questions time off task. Hiring  unqualified people  to be supervisors who never picked product favoritism, galore can’t even take a bathroom  break . Oh  yeah Bentley manager dumb as a stump along with Kevin bonk horrible manager   Juliet can’t  even talk and Jeremy mr restaurant manager a real horrible human being    They write you up  for anything Horrible Company The job was rough on your body since it requires a lot of lifting and pulling. However, the work itself required no real skill and it was only 5 hours a day part time. A typical day was 12+ hours of meeting on top of meeting. By the time it was over, it was time to start finishing actual work. Cut-throat behaviors were rewarded and inexperience is rampant. Management encouraged employees calling each other out during meetings. The best part of the job was the diversity and solving complex problems. good job for people who are very self-motivated but because of the high turnover don't expect your boss or your friends to stay very long. management were usually clueless and made certain days and interactions very frustrating. A typical work day is about 8 hours with two fifthteen minute breaks and one thirty minute lunch break. I learned to how to work at a fast pace and how to operate the slam area. Management is tough and in your face.The work culture is laid back at times and very freindly. The toughest part of the job was being asked to do things that other people were trianed for but not doing it. I really enjoyed interacting with my co-workers. Easy going and productive. For the most part every gets along and is well off. Very flexible with their schedules and overtime is guaranteed to you if wanted. I went through Amazon's mass hiring process, selected my shift based upon my life needs, passed background check, etc and then received a letter stating I was hired and would start at the New Hire Orientation. I showed up as scheduled and was sent home because they were over-booked. Meanwhile, they are trying to make me take a night shift--which I can't work because of obligations, and I had resigned my prior job based upon the confirmation letter to begin working at Amazon. Now, I am unable to pay my bills and keep being told, 'sorry for the inconvenience.' When I call in now they keep telling me I will be scheduled shortly based upon labor needs. It was a good learning experience working at Amazon. There is a lot of opportunities and business areas to work in and gain industry experience. And you get to take your dog at work! Ok company to work for. Not good with accommodating as far a schedule change due to school. Easy to move up in the company could be both a good thing and a bad thing. Management wasnt that great. I just got my job done and left. Enjoyed driving all the machines that i was placed on. I also enjoyed most of the people that worked there, that were actually nice. Hot stressful environment, the work was competitive and exhaustive. Very hostile environment. Very diverse culture. I hated the department I worked in which was very challenging. They fired people a lot. It was not a stable place of employment An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Amazon is a great company that has many opportunities for employees once the season is over. The managers there worked hard to insure that the consumer gets their package on time. Working for Amazon was a very enjoyable experience. It was my first job out of high school. It was a very laid back environment. They made it enjoyable to come to work. It was extremely fast paced and hard. They dinged you for not meeting goals even as a new hire. Breaks were only 15 minutes and restrooms were a good 5 minute walk away from work area. Before you start your shift all employees are required to stretch together as a group, so muscles are pulled from the walking as a picker. they had vending machines that gave you items you might need for the job you are doing , such as ear plugs gloves googles. During the actual shift you were required to make a curtain amount of items picked from the shelves. You were promised to go your own speed, so being over worked was not an issue. Management was nice enough to provide you with anything you needed for your job, such as soles for your shoes. Because our job was taxing on our feet, they provided foot support for your shoes. Which was nice because some people couldn't afford new shoes. With that said the most hardest part i thought of the job was, trying to make it from one end of the warehouse to the next before your 15mins were up. We were given two 15min, breaks, that were payed. Then a 30min, break that was not paid. Because the warehouse is so big, sometimes i spent my 15 min working. The benefits of working at amazon was pretty amazing. If you out picked everyone at the end of the month, you had a chance to win a flat screen or some other prize. like money. Pace was fine, managers were ok but seemed to lack people skills.  I was a manager in the Military so I know what I'm talking about.... this could account for high turnover rate.  People simply want to feel taken care of ...you will always get more work from a person who feels listened to and cared for.  I love to work.  I enjoyed the work.  I enjoyed the facility, the social aspect, meeting fellow workers and keeping pace with operations....near the end of the holiday season I did not feel challenged mentally,  no one picked up on that.  I felt 'under-utilized' No big deal.  Still a great experience.  I mentored those under me and those above me.  I have no problem with that.  I still felt like I was part of a great team and that I helped the process.  Once again, a great experience overall. Amazon is a great company for customers, not to work for.  If one ONLY cares about the size of their paycheck and is willing to sell their soul to the company, then Amazon is for you!  If one wants ANY kind of work life balance then run away- there are other companies that truly value their employees and see them as people As a work at home agent, I love working for Amazon.  There is consistent support and the pay is great!  The hiring process was not complicated at all and the perks are excellent. My day is picking items for shipment and making sure boxes does not smash when stacking. Music is playing when you arrive and everyone is friendly . Staying in one spot all day was hard to get used to but it’s getting better I met some great people while I was there. I think the managers are not strict enough with the employees & they favored some more than others. Mainly the ones who would hang around & do nothing. If there was another location opened in NYC, Manhattan I would definitely apply there. It would have to be above 34th street. Great coworkers and culture. They try to make it less stressful, but ultimately the stress got to me and made me so sick, I had to relocate back in with my parents. The 10 hour work days were long, and the only opportunity to even sit was at the breaks. The time spent walking to the break room was counted in the breaks, so a 15 minute break was more le a 10 minute break. However the rate at which they wanted work done was never impossible, or even difficult to achieve. I worked as a Warehouse worker for the PrimeNow. Although I loved the people I worked with, I hated the management. They never explained that I needed to check the portal website to schedule your shift, whereas other places had defined schedules. As such, I was terminated twice from Amazon because I 'abandoned' my position eventhough the management people told me 'wait for us to contact you'.However, I did run into great people working there and the work itself was easy enough. You could go on a lunch whenever you want so that was great too. This was a terrific place to work. My co-workers were wonderful. The company was hugely successful. Many great memories and a wonderful experience was had. its an 10 hour shift that people are wolfs in sheep clothing precisely wanting to reach the up graded position in the company i have been blessed with multi-facted knowledge from problem solve T.D.R. pallet receive heavy equipment operation. Management is a open air sercet  society a faternity hyprocisy an overflowing amount of preferential treatment. staying awake for a 10 hour shift, the possibility of excelling in the company. awful management awful workload awful attitudes awful working conditions awful hours awful pay awful accommodations awful company awful owner/ceothey don't pay sales tax (as most online retailers don't) and they still get tax incentives from local, state and federal governementsthey are killing other retailers (Toys R Us, Sears, etc)they will eventually replace all these job with robotsthey are a monopolythey hate unions and are anti-laborthey track your online shopping and browsingAlexa is listening ALWAYSthey suck Its a really good job when you are working full-time. Part-time workers are able to become full-time but its a certain period you can transition in. Personally, I hated my hours. I wanted more because I felt that if I am going to work this hard in a job then I should at least get a larger paycheck. I am used to the old P-S-P (People-Service-Profit) model when I used to work for FedEx many moons ago. The company took great care of their employees and in return, the employees went all out for the company that resulted in an outstanding profit for the company. This is how good companies should work, in my opinion. At Amazon, the human element is taken out of the workplace and is replaced by data where the computers rule and dictate management with an iron fist that subsequently treat their teams the same way. Benefits are good, but that however comes in the form of a give-and-take attitude (sarcastic form of frugality) that will eventually grow old with some people that will look for greener pasture. Be prepared to walk (at least) about 14 miles a day. If non stop walking/standing for 10-plus hours is not your thing, then this job will not be for you. In short, its not company, it is the way that the company is being operated that needs to be seriously reviewed. Easy to work everyone is willing to help and it’s easy to get hours if you don’t go to work  staff is friendly it’s super fast paced so be prepared to be on your feet all your shift you won’t alwaya be stuck doing the same thing so that makes it less boring and plus you learn new skills They lost my medical accommodations paperwork and didn't let me return to work, so I ran out of time off and was terminated because I couldn't come in. Go just to do your job, you wont find friends there. You can learn a lot but growing there is not that easy, everybody wants the same so is very competitive and sabotage is real. Just go and do what you have to do without complaining to much cause as soon as they know what you hate, they will make you do that EVERYDAY. Don't show your weaknesses. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. job made no since how all positions started off at the same pay even advancements with more responsibilities didn’t come with more pay, it’s a money hungry company with  minimalist pay just enough to keep people content. The company dropped an entire 3rd shift a day after Christmas a month before seasonal job was supposed to end, mind you the company broke selling records outselling Walmart I was a stower for about a month in a half before quitting mid shift. They have unrealistic quotes you have to meet each night. I was one of the fastest stowers starting out but it became very demanding and slave like. They don’t care if you’re one of the best stowers because the minute you slack off, they throw it in your face and constantly threaten you with write ups. Most nights you’ll have a pallet with very large items to stow away ex: (large toys, cat litter) with little to no pod space to stow them on. Which results in your (takt time) being extremely high and overall a bad production night for you. They monitor your time off from your station with a system called time off task. They monitor your time by scan to scan, meaning how long it takes you to scan one item to the next. Not mentioning it takes a good 5 mins to walk to the bathroom and you spend about a minute in the restroom rushing to get back and another 5 minutes to walk back to your station. They give you 30 mins time of task a shift. So don’t try and go more than once to the restroom a shift if you don’t want to go over that 30 minutes. It takes 10 whole minutes to walk to the break room so you’re really not getting you’re whole 30 mins break. I find myself scarfing down my food in 5 minutes. I like to feel relaxed on my lunch break without being rushed to get back to your station exactly 30 mins after your last scan. I can go on and on about this place. My review will turn into a book if i don’t stop now lol I don't even know where to begin!  If you like working in a high-stress work camp, then an Amazon warehouse is definitely for you.Work in an Amazon warehouse.  Form your own conclusions. great pay, lots of turnover, work schedule long, very fast paced. Great Benefits.   Most leaders don't last 2 years. systems are outdated, have to work day and night shift. 6 days a week during season-Nov to Dec This company views its employees as nothing but numbers. Horrible work environment. They follow you to your breaks and lunches to make sure you come back on time. Safety is ignored to the highest extent there. It’s a good place to work you get to meet a lot of new people just the work is hard, my saying is if you can work there for a year you can last forever if not it’s not for you Very centric to singular duties however there is a good deal of opportunity to both move up as well as laterally withing individual distribution centers. Incredible training opportunities. The part I liked the most about Amazon is everyone got a long really well. All the employees were always so friendly to everyone and made new people just as welcomed. The job itself is very easy and laid back. Pay is great for the work that we do, but getting shifts is impossible!! We're on a flex schedule, so shifts are posted and whoever gets to them first get them. The problem is because management hired way too many people, the second shifts are posted they're all gone. I'm not sure how others are getting shifts but I haven't worked in two weeks. I sit at my computer constantly refreshing the page waiting for shifts to be posted and I still have no luck. The manager is no help with this issue. Was a good seasonal job. Not great for advancement or a career. The managers did not care too much about their employees and were too busy playing with reps who like liked. Reproductive place, with little difficulties, and good pay. My customers had to book appointments for me to come out. People pick what package they want, and they list a price. I travel out to them, and carry out the service. I will, try my best to satisfy the customer. The job was ok until my feet and knee started hurting from the long hours. I enjoyed the benefits very much, one of the problems i had was i think they should have paid more. Management seems to have no idea what's going on and picks on specific people, while letting others get away with anything they want. Culture is awful. A typical day at work consist of warm ups, so we did not pull a muscle. Then we would load the trucks with products so the customers could get their packages at a timely manner. I also did bubble wrapping, which consist of wrapping packages in bubble wrap. I learned how to use a manual pallet jack. Overall I enjoyed the experience and learning new things. If you are in good shape, young, have no kids, and no spouse or significant other, this isn't a bad job. They pay is alright, but not enough to really live on your own. The benefits are probably the best part. But the hours are long and the shifts are awkward times. I work weekends so I have 0 work/life balance. Also, you work minimum of 10 hour shifts if you are full time, so it can be tiring. Management is pretty awful at my facility. They have no clue what is really going on, and they claim they listen to associates but they really don't or things would actually change.Only thing I really got out of Amazon is some good friends. Working at Amazon was an amazing experience. It was a fast paced job, especially around the holiday seasons. The job could get stressful especially if there was not any work, making it hard to make rate. Really fast paced and great benefits. Need to make sure you are making rate at all times. Also family life has been interrupted by working so many hours and overtime during peak as well. My experience was AWESOME!  I started during a Christmas season and at that time, we got free meals, bonus snacks, OT perks, gift cards and were just shown APPRECIATION.   I lost 32 lbs in a year of just walking and being on my feet for 10 hrs a shift and loved knowing that my friends and relatives were getting their orders correctly and fast!I have always recommended this company!!! Offers flexible schedules, and does overtime sometimes. The breakroom is large and has lots of snacks. The work is easy and not as bad compared to other warehouses. This is not really designed for the person looking to live on this job. It is great for extra cash as you can work as few or many shift as you can grab when they become available. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Have nothing to say they fired me because someone lied and said that they felt threatened by me sing snitches get stitches, I have nothing more to say nice relaxed place people are fun to be around at times can get hectic from time to time... depending on what area you are placed in.... you could be anywhere such as reciving unloading trucks placing packages on a conveyor line to stocking where the line loaders remove the items from your isle line and onto your cart for you to stock into the proper shelfs and scaned properly The work was sustainable however the pay lacked greatly. No overtime and no room for advancement. The company overall is very wonderful and if given a better pay I would like to stay and grow within. That is what I am look for. I like working with thousands of people. Most are very hard workers.I look forward to getting into a higher paying position.Amazon may be the place I start my CDL career. Fun and face paced warehouse with room for advancement within the company. Flexible work hours but they also have a zero tolerance policy that they’re very strict with This place is fast paced and hot. Thank goodness they added fans and portable ac units around the building. Training isn't that great but the workers are great at helping you understand and catch up. Working at amazon was amazing and fun because I had a very nice supervisor and team lead.Lovely and clean environment which is climate controlled.Thanks Not bad place to work .They lay me off right at mine 90 days. They didnt call me and let me know i drove up there and couldnt get in the gate or doors. Worse place to work, treat employees awful, they fire for stupid stuff that's personal and off the clock, they only keep u a bit..if u go to be they blame the situation in u without explanation, huge turn around always It takes a certain type of person to enjoy working at Amazon. It is fast paced and stressful at time. But the reward is that you are shipping thousands and thousands of packages to countless satisfied customers.. all while working for an industry leader. Working at an Amazon station was fast paced, demanded attention to detail, and brought forth career advancement quickly. A typical day involved sorting packages, managing Amazon Flex routes, and overseeing a team to accomplish afteroon/evening goals. I always thought highly of Amazon until I started there. Human Resources is rude and not helpful. They are not concerned with your issues and there is no willingness to help. You are not trained appropriately to do the job. Each person has a different perspective on what should be done and how. The only good thing is the flexibility in hours. The pay is not enough for what is expected. Be prepared to break, get sick, and feel under appreciated. Don’t understand why I need 150 characters when my 3 points are very valid. The job is draining. The only plus is weight loss, and if you’re lucky enough to get paid every week. Amazon is a great temporary place to make extra money. It is Not a career job, simply a means for extra funds quickly. The hiring process took about 2wks , fairly quick. No bs, orientation, one day training and then work. Its straight to the point, they want you working and your there for the money. Show up, check what area you are working in, pick up a scanner, quick 5 min stretch along with any announcements and then everyone is off to work. They expect 180 boxes per her, which sounds like a lot but that includes envelopes and with you picking 2 or more at a time, its easily achieved. Sometimes its super fast paced, others its at reg speed depending on the shipment that day. Time does go quickly and you have no time to sit and gossip, however members are friendly enough to help you if you seem lost. Its a warehouse job, you should go in with the mindset your going to work . 4hrs shifts go by quick, when busy 1 hr extra is mandatory however on slow days you are prone to work only 3hrs and be done. Its a job, not a career . I feel that the management in place cares very little about their employees.  They take credit for things they did not do.  Very micromanaging to the littlest detail. Being a picker for Amazon was one of the hardest job I've encountered. It was a fast paced, quick moving, and no screw up job.  The work staff however were wonderful and very helpful. Very structured and driven company.  General laborer employees are treated like robots and many leave the company to either distress or 'on the job' medical conditions.  There are a lot of OSHA discrepancies.  Schedules are not flexible.  If you want to work there, you take what is available. A typical day working at Amazon is coming in clock in stretch get your device and get your section and being to work. Working at Amazon Ive learned that working as a team is very important. Great atosphere with really fun people to work with, Met so many characters there and talked with some really cool customers, They are a really relaxed company and im sad i dont work for them anymore Amazon was a great place to work at from the management all the way to the custodial crews. Nothing ever negative about working at this place, I enjoyed every hour working there. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. It is great for short term. If you want to stay for long term take advantage of their career choice. They have good benefits and the starting pay is decent, My experience was very good with Amazon.Learnt a lot of new things. The made me scrum master, which was my first experience of my &! year of career. Amazon was an amazing place to work, but the pay was low for the amount of work you do. They finally have raised the wages to $15, but have removed the monthly bonuses and stock options which means you're making just about the same. Favoritism decides if you'll be trained for certain functions and promotions. i really enjoyed my time at amazon and only left because i unfortunately ran out of time i could take off. We didn't know it at the time we were dealing with some serious medical issues at home with my Son and thus i didnt deal with it appropriately with HR and the time loss cost me my job A typical day at work starts with stand up and some pointless stretching. Then you get your assignment for the day/night with will 100% of the time change at some point. It's a good place to work if you need flexibility and pays above minimum wage, but it's not a job to rely on as your only source of income unless you can get a full time position. good people and good work area would like to do it again!how to do things properly at amazon warehouse hardest part of job maybe sweating and being on your feet all day sometimes i say.being with people and having fun while being busy working. Fun and fast paced. If you like working in a high productive area with friendly people then this is the job for you. The management is very hands on and willing to help and all of the coworkers are very friendly Works Amazon part time off loading trailers as well as scanning orders from trailers coming into the property for local distribution to customers. A great place  to work. A place to have fun meet new people and make customers happy. Work Safely with a team reaching targets and setting new goals. My best part was the perks and enjoyed running stand-up each day working side by side with my manager. Too many questions targeted you as an 'undesirable.' I was discharged, but told I could appeal due to my above average score in the mid-size items to be stowed. Ridiculous! Certain policies and practices are down right hypocritical. Amazon is a great place to work, I just do not like competing for shifts. Other than that pay is great and the managers are really helpful. It is not a stressful work environment. Amazon was a wonderful employer. They took great care of their employees and even paid them above minimum wage.The workplace culture was wonderful and healthy. I would say that all the staff at the call center genuinely cared about other employees and had resources available to help any one in need. It's a nice and easy job really. The worst part (aside from weather and traffic) is that you have to try and get shifts. They sometimes will hold a shift for you but that stopped for me a year ago because they over hire to a huge degree. Some odd routes here and there but overall nothing too painful. Great company to work for. Staff and other team members were very helpful with assisting new hires. Most of the phone was repeative, which made the work day pretty easy. A typical day at Amazon includes receiving inventory, consulting and teaching customers about our Amazon products. Merchandising and Marketing methods are changed every week based on promotions.  Everyone is responsible for checking their emails in order to stay in the loop of all the updates. If things get a little slow, play with devices and create something cool with the routines feature so when customers come in, you can demonstrate. It is worst company to be employed the associates do not have any rights Amazon only cares about their challenge of product not the rights of employee they are not deserve to work for them. Worked in the summer, very fast and busy at peak times. There will be times of forced overtime or going home early due to early or late shipments arriving. I was a picker and you had to get to a area at a certain time or manager would come and explain your time off task.you had 1 30 mins. break the whole time there. some people talked a lot while working and when you had to get in the area they looked at you like you was interrupting their conversation. I worked here for a short time while in between jobs. I was an order picker. Amazon warehouse will kick your a**, into shape that is. They warn you during training that you will have pain in your legs and they weren't kidding! Even for some of us more fit folks, it's still quite a workout. You are expected to stand for 10-12 hours a day, no sitting or leaning. Other than standing,  you are consistently using your legs to squat, kneel, or climb the ladder to grab product. Once you grab the product, you simply toss it into the designated bin. This job is extremely fast paced, but it can feel good at the end of the day to workout. Drink A LOT of water- they have water stations everywhere and even post about how important hydration is on the bathroom stalls. Best part about working here was undoubtedly the benefits: Amazon has really good insurance. They also offer up two kinds of PTO you can use, at any time. One kind is accepted upon request, others you can use no matter what. And that is all included as of DAY ONE! You are also left alone for the most part during your day, so you don't have to worry about a supervisor constantly breathing down your neck. They will pop in occasionally to make sure you are hitting your quality numbers, but it is definitely not a place to feel anxious.Worst part about working here was the breaks- you are given the same amount of break time as you would be at pretty much any other full time job, an unpaid 30 min and 2 15s. The issue with this is that the building is so large it takes a few mins to even exit. And with all of the physical labor,  you need more break time to eat, hydrate, etc. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Easy job but not worth 10 hours every day. Far commuteLong day, when you come home you have to go to work within the next few hours againYou can become sore if you don't work out4 days a week, not bad Amazon loves is customers, not its employees. At least in the department I worked in.  I left for a job closer to home, less hours and almost double pay. Las horas de trabajo son buenas.  Pero el trabajo es pesado, la meta de realizar 540 envios por horas.  Aunque el ambiente de seguridad en el empleo es bueno. going in was easy. very fun in the start. keeping up the rate can be hard for stowing or mostly anywhere in amazon, stowing is pretty much standing up for a10 hr shift putting items in these containers and you gotta make them fit big items or small items. each item is 1 and to be at a good rate of 150 items an hour. i left cause other departments had it more easy than others, people in a different area didnt need a rate like we did they were more relaxed while others struggled more, we had cameras on us 24/7 (stowing) while others didnt even have that. i did both jobs so i know. if you arent fast paced they will terminate you The job was cool . Super tiring and super fast oaced . If you don’t keep up with the speed they want you to work at you’ll be fired after a while . So be careful . You're responsible for your time, basically you can't be late more than a certain amount of times or you'll be terminated. Hours are set and you must work 40 hrs a week or you'll be in trouble. Using the bathroom is a hassle, you literally can't go unless a supervisor covers you. Mostly enjoyed the hours broken down in a 4 day span. Work was simple and productivity was optimal. Workspace is big and focus on work was pretty easy. very hard and managers are horrible they treat you like an animal and honestly to them you are just a number. I was there busting my but off and it never got recognized Poor training, set up for failure, no advancement or cross training, manager have no understanding on how to utilizing their employees abilities and knowledge on varies tasks. No consideration for loyalty nor dependability. I would say it is a decent job for someone who is in need of work, but the environment could definitely be improved. The treatment of employees could also be improved. Relatively a good place to work but one has to concentrate and be very much accurate and fast  in executing your responsibilities especially  working amongst younger  indivuals. i did enjoyed my stay, Unorganized  and hot , a whole bunch of packages to handle and if not done at a certain time an extra hour is added onto shift  other than that amazon wasn’t very bad at all It was just too far away from where I lived First, I am a previous employee of amazon. I worked for the company for 12 months.  I worked in ICQA.  I was a lead training ambassador.  I trained close to 300 people.  I did my job well, and actually took pride in my role.  I also was a problem solver.  Until to day I was released,  I had NO blemish on my record. No writes-up of any kind.  never stole from the co., no sexual harassment allegations, no security breaches, no insubordination, no write up of too many errors or productivity, or anything to the such.  And I'm not trying to say I'm a perfect person. Like anyone else I've made mistakes.  I was released because I exceeded my UPT. Not by a lot, about 2-3 hours. I tried to fight for my job and even tried to appeal, thinking since I had a good work record w/ no write-ups, the co. could see some value in all the hard work I've done in the past year.  This was to no avail.  so to me and other, no matter how much you do or how long you manage to stay, one mistake and you will be fired. warehouse side, it was a total nightmare. often i wasn't allowed to take a lunch during my shift due to them wanting more bodies on the floor. store side, the work was easy but everyone skipped out on working leaving few people to complete orders. They need to take a step back and look at the management again. a good part time job though. Pretty uptight with a lot of projects.  If you are interested in learning more, it's the place.  The AWS technology is becoming a must have skillset, so you will either willing to learn or already know the skill I'm a motivated person with a lot of goals and dreams I never give up on my ability to go for more. I have strong faith and I always do my best to set up and accomplish my goals. I did pick orders on the floor and in the air with an OP or forklift. It was a good job, fast-paced, and always busy. If downtime occurred, I would be summoned to the dock area to help load 6 or 7 trucks at the same time. It was challenging but the time went by fast and you definitely lose weight if you're doing lots of walking. Amazon was a reliable job with good people but the hours were stressful and prone to be given mandatory overtime during busy areas. Your working hours can be shifted as needed with little warning and HR policies are rather strict. There is very little if any time between customer interactions (hardly enough to finish after-call work) which can be stressful but does make the day go by faster. The company does make up for some of the stress with lots of events and optional activities, good break room facilities and amenities. its a okay place to work i need better hours and more cash i wored nights and  wanted to have a day job and more times with my friends and family . there was good times and bad times but it was good over all This is the kind of place that says safety first.  But it is production numbers first all day.  Seems someone was leaving in an ambulance every other week An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. This company provide some benefit like 401 K , paid time off, and career choice that are very good.I am enrolled in college studying Computer Information System and career choice program contributes 3000 annual dollars for my education. This is a modern day slave ship! They don't care about the strain on your feet, they only care that you push yourself hard enough to make their determined rate. Some managers are great, and they're just doing their job. This job is very taxing on the body. The CEO doesn't care! No one prepared me for what was expected to do this job. I felt like i had to sign my life  away just to find out what my job duties entailed. The people who work as slaves there say that they hate it there, but that they need the money. Some have told me that they have developed arthritis. This is a horrible job! I feel like I'm dying slowly every day. I'm glad I worked at Amazon for 1.5 years because I learned a ton, but ultimately, I didn't align with the work culture or values. In my experience, it didn't feel like Amazon cares about their employees; they're about the bottom line. Team work is not a leadership principle at Amazon, which cultivates a culture of competition and always trying to be the best. Be mindful of how much you give to Amazon because nobody is going to tell you to slow down. A really fast pace. To work with in the warehouse in Amazon meet new people good hard worker s in Amazon  great manager Brent .l learn allot good things I loved going to work, always meeting new people, and receiving benefits though I was part time. They always gave you the tools to perform your job, such as box cutters, vests, gloves, ear plugs. If you are quality control you are lucky. Better than moving those boxes all day. Good first job but anything after that and you should work somewhere else. Little to no room for advancement. The mileage they expect you to drive does not make up for the money they pay.  They are always trying to get you to take less money than the job is worth. Getting delivery blocks is very time consuming and some days there are no block available.  It's hit or miss. Just not enough hours and they make it really hard to transfer to full time. For the most part it is laid back, but at times really fast paced to make sure that all of the packages go out on time. working at amazon was very fast pace. it was long hours but the hours flew when work was going fast. I was able to get promoted and become a trainee. I was able to learn a lot of different other roles and wasn't stuck to just one job. For a part time job it was okay. The shifts went by quickly and I liked all the walking around. What I didn't like was working with all the people that were not interested in working hard. They were there just to get a paycheck. Benefits are the only reason to work here.  Too much favoritism, hard on your body especially if you already  have pre-existing conditions such as arthritis.  Now that vcp is gone, even less incentive to work.   Needs a union badly to protect the hard working employees.  Not enough job rotation Good part time job fair pay . paid training, and great team environment would recommend to a friend or family member. And its on the bus line good job all around People who go far in Amazon are the ones who do not stay in the position and job type for longer than a year and a half.  The culture encourages everyone to apply for other internal jobs and learn new skills or get the educational to apply for those jobs.  Once you reach Level 4 status it is easier to move around in the company and make connections. Working at Amazon was very grueling. While working, the associates had to stand the entire 10 hours of working while working on dealing with returns. All we did was work on the return boxes and figuring out if an item could be reused again or had to be thrown away. The environment is very loud because of the machines we were working on but pretty much employees were quiet during work. Amazon also had a minimum of boxes each employee had to reach every day. After training and working at the facility for a few weeks, after a month they want their new and current employees to achieve to do 10-12 boxes an hour which equals 100-120 boxes a day and equals 400-420 boxes a week for the four days employees work. I learned that returns are hard work, and if you get locations on where things need to go wrong, it reflects on everybody working in the other areas of the facility and not just yourself. I didn't get too much time to get to know my manager, while I was working at Amazon I mostly got help from people who were working at the facility longer than I had. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and earning good money. When I first started at amazon, I liked it. The managers were nice and the atmosphere was relaxed. Then the old managers left to go to other locations and they were replaced with horrible managers - managers who made coming to work a dreadful experience. When I first started working for amazon things were tough my feet hurt but my pay increased big time. I would recommend this career to those who love to work , fast-paced and with a purpose. sleep is a must and yes you can sleep , you now select the days you wish to work it was nothing like back when they first opened.( 2015), I am now satisfied and is in school things are working out for the better currently I am with sizemore.inc and i will be back with amazon the new one it is decent and gives employees much more respect and courtesy time and is very stable....just be like nike and do it especially if you need to move or buy a car or better yet start a new career.peace I have no complaints of working in Amazon.com. I was treated very fair. I had problems and they were willing to help me at any given chance. I loved the stock options. Good insurance. I liked that they trained each employee for each aspect of the job. We were taught how to use the scan guns in addition to distributing and stowing the packages. As a season job it's great. You go in, do your job, get paid.If you are looking to advance and become part of the leadership team, be prepared for more stress than the pay is worth. Amazon is overall a good company there are unfortunately a few minor adjustments that could be made. I have worked as a supervisor before of 3 departments and there are some things that I would do different.I do like to come to work but it is very hard to get the hours you need to make a living and pay for health insurance outside the company and other bills that a person may have. There are also to many restrictions for a qualified person to advance in the company because of certain managers ethics. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Fun place to work at when you need a quick job. You can meet great people. Vto is the great thing they have to offer at amazon pto is another thing that is good. Pros:Hours fit well with my daytime job. The time went by quickly and the position goals were easily met. Cons:There was little hope for advancement to a full-time position. A typical day a work sometimes. Was good and sometimes was bad to be in. But it was a good job to be at and make good money and good people to work with. Enjoyed the job. Paid training, walked 12+ miles per day, took a month to physically get used to the pace, focused work, great time to think and de-stress, bonuses. Sent home on occasion based on production but still worked 40 hours a week. I'm happy to start working for amazon because I love working with people and doing new thing. I love making money for the family.Help people out in life Fulfillment Associate. Amazon Fulfillment Associates are among those on the front line fulfilling customers' orders within the Fulfillment Centers. The ideal candidate is focused on the customer experience, quality, safety, and productivity. I have been working for Amazon as a picker for a 1.5 years. I started as a temp hire in PA and eventually advanced into an Amazon employee. I recently transferred to Florida at a brand new facility. I am an ambassador, and can be utilized in most of the facility. I am a hard worker who is always wanting to learn new things. Management is great and has been at all locations I have worked at. Hardest part of my job would be the amount of times I have been denied the Managers PA position. My brother and I were each tested, interviewed, given employee numbers, took and passed drug and background tests, and were told we would be notified by e-mail of a start date. This never happened. When I called the employee concern line, I was told that HR wasn't  ready to start training yet. (This was for a personal shopper position at Whole Foods.)  After waiting for a month, we finally got employment elsewhere. I will never work for Amazon. They lied about the start date, and everything else. We went through some time and trouble, going across town, using our time, gasoline, and not to mention the wasted resources,  and then they got our hopes up needlessly. What a sham. Not for me. This job is good for people with no experience and ok with not making enough money for the hard physical labor that they require each employee to put in. keeps you on your toes, good place to work, good benefits, a team is friendly. nice work environment would recommend to someone whos looking to start off. Stable job, have fun people to work with and socialize with dear, good vision and dental benefits, decent wage, Amazon pays for 95% of your school up to an associates degree if you work with Amazon for 1 whole year, and there is a possibility of advancing your career or moving up in the company if you become an Ambassador. Every 2 years you can move up in the company starting from ambassador to Shift Assistant to Logistics to Site Manager to Area Manager and etc. A typical day of work consists of working fast while standing, lifting up to 50 pounds, and bending.The starting positions are all physically demanding. Management are all friendly. What I hated the most was how they constantly monitor you about everything. If you have a low rate for any reason, you will have someone from management coming to you to find out why. The equipment also frequently doesn't work properly and you have to move to a different station. When I worked at Amazon, I got the impression that Amazon doesn't care about their employees , only about the required rates. They give out some nice raises but I hated the work environment. Business driven working environment, very competitive.A bunch of conference and community events for networking and socialization.Management chain is too long. Amazon was a great place to work and if i have a chance to go back i will. They care about everyone that works there and makes you feel really proud to work for Amazon. Even though I set records and won awards for my production in 3 department, I never felt valued or appreciated. No matter how much you do it never seems to be enough. Managers seem to have a very short tenure. Pay is below iindustry standards. I was there for 6 yrs. Taking the buy out made me happier than I had been in a long time !!!! Before working there is always a meeting with the staff members and were all stretching since the shifts are long and we are on our feet the whole time staying busy. During my time as a Picker, the production standards were very unreasonable.  Temporary/contract employees were included in holiday meal and snacks during afternoon breaks but were not given other perks available to 'employees' even though we outnumbered the regulars significantly.  Parking was a nightmare.  Long hard hours of work walking 20+ miles most days, with 6 day work weeks for Peak. I was okay when I first started,  they have some of the best training.  I worked in receiving as a warehouse associate, was trained on damages, and problem solving and became one of their best problem solvers on the shift but was promoted to a processing assistant after a second go round because when I bid on the job the first time I was never told if I got it or not, or why I didn't get it.   Got promoted after the second go around but it was only a dollar raise so $12 for solving receiving problems,  auditing, and handing damages which wasn't really worth it.   My supervisor was okay but I was not happy that he tried to get a person that I trained to problem solve promoted before me when we applied at the same time and i was the one she came to when she couldn't solve a receiving problem, yet I was the fastest most effective problem solver.  And if they needed another problem solver in any other area, i was the one that sent because they knew i would do the job right. I felt like there was some racism with that. Its a great place for warehouse begginers to develole work skills they fall nothing short of excellent. They care a lot about their workers and will work with you to insure your safety! The pays alright not the best but definitely not the worst! If your not money motivated don't waste your time they believe in work you have to have some time off experience in Warehouse and logistics to understand how important your role in Amazon is and driven by money set a goal and work towards it An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Loved this job, only left due to serious medical issue. Fun place to work. Fast paced and always busy. Opportunity for overtime. Would go back if I didn’t live so far away Loved working there , loved the people there too it is a great place to work. the people there were very helpful, just learning the systems seemed the hardest Needs better leaders at Amazon Cle 5 location.  Great pay, unstable hours. Made friends,  clean facility.  If you want to work at Amazon, make sure you have the shoes on. It was a nice job had great co workers nice majangers the schedule was accomdating. They did stretches everyday told us how many boxes we had for the day vendin machines and clean bathrooms. In all honesty everything is cutthroat here, you may make friends here but in truth, they are more or less after the same job as you and won't hesitate to do what they can to get it. Don't bother going to your Supervisor and talking to them about moving up and what you can do. The second they feel you are going after their job, they will get you fired and spread rumors. This is first hand experience. was a clean, straightforward work environment with excellent management and company goals that appreciated hard work and internal growth. Would have loved to stay, but home life took over for the time being. I would definitely recommend a job with Amazon to my friends and family if given the chance. Amazon is a huge company with the coolest and latest technologies. However, the company culture is really bad. Managers made their decisions based on their interests. I go to work and we start off with excersices then we start our work for 12hrs, My only goal at work is to finish and keep a steady pace.They have paid time off. A very fast paced work environment. A very up beat and competitive work zone. They also have a very relaxed dress code that makes it easier to work. Work isnt awful, but managment is incompetant.the conditions are absolutly terrible, 10 minute break in a 10 hour shift. We had people passing out, getting hit from falling objects, ect. Four ten hour days a week was a good schedule, the work was kind of tedious but for the pay it was worth it. They also promote from within so it is easy to advance with them if you want to It's a ok job to have you it pays your bills and you have to be flexible but the people the run the business treat you like family. It's a job I can't really say anything bad about the job Working there for over 2 years all I heard “we promote within” but rarely occurred they always hired from outside. They always want you to go faster but to always maintain quality. If you get written up in the area your no good at guess what your staying there. Benifits are great,PTO,Vacation etc but it was just very cut throat Perfect job if it's your 2nd job and you need A LITTLE extra money. I say that because if you come there after working another job, that's the only way you can be happy on the days you  work less than a full shift (which is too often.)They raising the minimum wage but they don't give raises. Unless you are a manager, there is no advancement. Good people, good ideas, good training but they just don't pay enough/ have enough hours. As much money as I think they make/ save I think they should invest in their employees. They would probably be up there with Google if they did. it wasnt a bad place to work. there are several job positions one can get inside amazon, the stow ann pickers positions require high productivity an for stowers its hard to get the numbers they expect when you cant find room in the boxs to store the clothing. I would really like to work there  and diligent.  I will put all my effort into the work and I won't disappoint them signing me into their company... The Amazon culture isn't as awful as some people say.  The job is great if you are comfortable in a warehouse and are willing to come in everyday to do your job.  If you aren't able to keep up in a fast paced career, Amazon will not be for you.  The job is all about the customer, as it should be.  It's hard work, but the benefits and incentives make it all worth it. The benefits are awesome but there is a lot that could change. Very fast paced and the pick patterns are horrible.You get pulled around a lot. Very physically demanding. Very nice company to work for with extraordinary benefits. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a career with a great company. You get paid time off and unpaid time off. Performs cross-training in picking/ packing, stowing, 6-sided quantity control, receiving products Assisting in production administer the implementation of the ongoing Workforce Staffing On-boarding and Training program, facilitate program content, Coordinate the extensive program logistics, and assist new hires with all aspects of the program. Facilitated of the everyday challenging operations. Amazon is great because expectations are very clearly lined out, even though some positions include a little ambiguity. On my first day we went over all the 'leadership principals' that Amazon values in each position. Investigation Specialist itself is a repetitive job, but the value gained and the opportunity ahead is worth working hard at it regardless. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. amazon fresh was a fast paced and cut throat job you never knew if what was going on and could be fired at any time. there are plenty of good people there but are hindered buy the fact that you never know what is going on till start of shift i was temp for the holidays old equipment in the facility where I was. pretty boring job. mgt is always changing something to stay employed there. not a go place to work , they pressure you to you meet a quota. they let anybody rive power equipment with little to no experience. Good work place but needs work as far as management and the third party leave of absence company. Overall if these things get fixed the job is outstanding Amazon is the best company I have worked for to date. I would not leave this company, but would love to partner with another company with similar values, mainly customer obsession. Lots of political stuff goes on behind the scenes and doesn't foster an environment of cooperation and working towards a common goal for the company or team. Very stressful environment with ridiculous expectations. 10-12 hour shifts on your feet with huge gaps between breaks. Ridiculous goals to reach, not considerate. Amazon is tough. It's going to make you sweat, no doubt. I worked closely with Inbound and Outbound. We worked hard. However it's extremely easy to find someone to friend. There's so many different demographics at Amazon you are sure to find a friend. At Amazon it's the strong who survive. As long as you work hard and show compassion in the jobs that you are assigned you will love your job at Amazon. The community of people are amazing, however the management is not. They treat you horribly. But no need to worry, they're hardly ever managing anything anyways so you'll hardly see any on the floor. Most of them are right out of college and think of themselves as hot shots. They can be disrespectful, talk down to you, and will make you work harder while they stand around and point their fingers. Amazon is a great job, as long as you don't have to deal with management. I loved the job, as a shy person I was able to step out of my shell and work with other people who I would have never imaged. I've made a lot of close friends while also learning the warehouse job. its really a face paced working, its tiring if you're working with people that are lazy and not willing to work as hard as us, because it makes the job more dificult and more stressfull On your feet for 10-12 hours. gotta keep up with a certain percentage or else you'll be fired. Managers were really cool. depending on your job you might have to walk alot Currently working at the JAX 3 warehouse.  I had never worked in a warehouse ever so it was all new to me.  Before the raise to $15 an hour, I would have said the pay does not compensate you for the work.  However $15 seems fair to me (although I have no other warehouse experience to compare it to).  The health benefits are actually really great, very low cost for great health care (I am on the share deductible plan).  Keep in mind, although $15 an hour is great, ALL employees are getting that.  So the person who doesn't do their part, gets $15.  The 'injured, requiring light duty forever', gets $15.  If that is going to bother you, don't work here.  I hear the regulars complain (funny that it's socialism at work and now they don't like it when it's happening to them lol)  The work is very physically demanding but I happen to like being active all day long.  The breaks are too short, 30 minutes for lunch just flies by you have to eat fast.  Most of the rumors I had heard are not true, like no bathroom breaks, too many people racing to get to time clocks or lunch room.  Not true.  They stagger the shifts to avoid that.  I don't like being on the equipment but everyone gets trained on it no matter what.  Now on to my biggest complaint:  Management.  They literally have kids right out of college trying to tell people how to run a warehouse with zero experience.  I'm being very honest here.  Their are so many qualified, experience people who could have that warehouse running so smoothly and why Amazon officials do not use them I do not know.  The 'kids' in charge are really just  cheerleaders put there to motivate other 'kids' to go faster with everything.  Their expectations of the work they want accomplished by the end of the day is impossible with the management they have in place.  They are extremely backed up outside with trucks and no one in management has shown an efficient plan to get the work done.  If Amazon would make use of the men and woman who know this work, then it would be amazing what they could accomplish. It's a shame they don't really.  You have a mix of ages, the 18-25 and the 40-60.  Two very different work ethics going on.  The younger need the cheerleaders, the older just want to work and don't need a cheerleader and recognize poor inefficient management immediately and it is frustrating.  Making rate is not hard if you just stay busy.  The time off you earn is not good enough to me either.  You only earn about 4 days of paid time off in a whole year. Only a little over an hour a pay check for vacation time.  So having said all that, I still like the job very much, it fits me.  I would not quit over the management unless I was held responsible for not getting something done due to their own inability to organize things.  I'm hoping Amazon  leaders will eventually see the wisdom in putting people in charge who actually KNOW this environment and could make them so much better and stop putting kids right out of college with no experience in charge of something they literally know nothing about.  Hope the review helps someone! I held a temporary position at the RIC2 in Virginia for a holiday season, however due to car and shoulder trouble i moved on to other endeavors once the term had ended. I moved to North Carolina, and quite frankly cant wait for a factory to be built near me. Great source of temp work for those that need a little extra cash, or just want to get their foot in the door somewhere. Highly recommend working for amazon in packing department. I Started in the ICQA Dep. as graveyard shifts form 6:30pm to 5am for about almost a year. I kept applying for morning shifts, I was then told that it depended on work performance, in which I always was amongst the top three on productivity. Then, I was told that shift transfer depended on sonority, in which I saw newer employees who got along great with management, get a career advancement, or shift transfer of choice. My son needed me, and my health started declining here, I could not afford to miss doctor visits, so I had to let my job go It is a great company with amazing opportunities; where you have the chance to grow in every position. I would definitely recommend my family to work in this company where you make your new family who supports you in every way and helps you with every problem. Good computer knowledge Not much of a work cultureThe most enjoyable part is the employeesManagement could be worked onI learned a lot of computer skills it has been over 12 years since working as a temp, things can change over a period of time, this is not the review to use based on everday changes companies have Basic Warehouse at Amazon FC. When I was there it was very cut-throat. Worked at inbound as picker and stower.  Eventually moved up to being a Problem Solver. They really focus on rate,rate,rate... Loved my job loved the work happy with my hours. Emergency came up had to leave out of the country. Was told after a year I could reapply same position and now they're not accepting my application. Very disappointed was told I could do and wouldn't have any problems and now they're not even interested in my application. Not happy! the company is terrible management is garbage at best. i have been poisoned by the company. ive learned to not question the intelligence of the idiots running the building. They need to fix the parking situation or else be more forgiving of being late, little longer lunch and breaks for such a big warehouse and working 12 hours, you do't have much time once you walk to the front; besides that it was a good company An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. The managers want you to do your best and some are friendly. Its a competitive environment which is fun in my P.O.V., they offer rewards for hard working people and I always got second place. I would recommend working there, especially during seasonal. Intense working culture, did not have the feeling of support from team. Would have wanted more guidance from mentor and teammates working on the same project, was not given that guidance. Amazon was a great place to work, Amazon test each employee before hiring and it turns out to be such a great assessment that they get great employee's who pull and work together to get the job done. It was truly a team driven experience. We pulled together at a Whole Food Store. And filled on-line orders. The only draw back is that Amazon does not give you a schedule. They post schedule openings on-line and it is a first grab first get situation. So unless you have the latest iPhone you  may not get much time on the schedule. I was only able to get a day or two every two weeks. The culture at Amazon was really laid back. Co-workers were awesome but the leaders were too inconsistent with one another. One told you to go left, the other told you to go right. Sub contractor on the build of Amazon distribution , we did the firealarm installation and was complaint to California state regulation and had daily meetings to meet the CTO date Surfboard, bugle boys and cheerleaders every day, depending on what team wins is how you come out. Run to you station than run behind the winners normally you don't come out, hit the bench till they get rid of you. They act like a bunch of bunnies hip-hop to their tone. I was told enter in cross a line of no return then asked by them for the game of star track from me to win like getting hired but having to win the job at the same time, and boy did I blank right up out of there, don't think I didn't try to win, everybody needs a job. Too many 3rd party vendors involved, no communication, no accountability, repetitive breach of contract between Amazon and Integrity on Amazon behalf (inaccurate workflow forecasting demanded increased volume and speed of onboarding, which resulted in mass layoffs just BEFORE the holidays); delayed compensation with promotions, minimal training, unethical business practices (forcing all employees to remain standing for hours on end while the 'floor' was down due to robot-related issues. Pay issues with ADP cards (multiple new employees went up to 6 weeks without pay, others went through 5+ cards), badge issues, constant attendance issues related to badge problemsInconsistent workflow organization by AmazonInefficient use of personnelHate to relive this, but what stood out to me the most was all the people crying when they were let go, and the others who were angry they still had not been paid for weeks on end (including death threats caused by the latter).State of CT Department of Labor was notified, investigated grievances. To this day I personally boycott anything related to Amazon because the bottom line is Bezos is so selfish and greedy that his cut-throat business model prioritizes managing data over people.  I personally can attest that if you have the acumen to properly manage, coach, and motivate the workers, the data will fall into place.  They do not care about a single employee.  Some of their best employees have been suddenly relocated without notice.  You can't make this stuff up!! Domestic violence incidents in front of the building, workers  avoiding management in order to manipulate the VTO show-up pay system because Amazon screwed up forecasts again and didn't want to allow workers to punch in for the day...it goes on and on... overall,  a wonderful experience. However fast paced environment with high stress levels. Good management and problem solving team. Wonderful open door policy. go in get scanners get assigned to a section didn't need scanner if working the sort table or if driving the equipment but very fast paced and made new friends. Long and something to get use to. I learned that you have to work hard. Its very big and cold and not much excitement. The hardest part of the job is working 10 hour shifts or longer. great place to work for a first time job, and to possibly build a career out of, they provided paid schooling after you have been there for 2 years, great place Even though I was hired for a 7:30 am - 5:00 PM shift, after my first day orientation, I was told that the only thing that they had was 6:30 pm - 5:00 am available. Please make sure that if you can't work the hours that they want, it may not be worth the time and effort! A decent job if you're willing to work hard every day to make rates. They will notice if you do not make rates, and you will be written up and eventually let go if you cannot reach their standards. There are chances to move up in the company, but they are very rare and hard to achieve, even if you are one of the hardest working people in the warehouse. Some positives, benefits are nice and start day one. And starting November 1st, a $15/hour minimum wage is being implemented. That's about it for the positives. Be prepared for long-shifts, short unsatisfactory breaks, the constant threat of being written up for numerous reasons, not being able to have your phone on you or any music, and being stuck doing the same thing for sometimes months on end. They will preach about being a team, but in all honesty could care less if you quit or get fired. If you do end up going for a job in a warehouse, I would recommend that you do it temporarily while still looking for another job. The stress that comes with this job is hardly worth working there. Please check out and consider other places first, as Amazon should a last resort. Best place to work...Amazon makes coming to work fun..you can win gift cards prizes and more..you are given 20 hrs every 3 months to use how you want to Productive and fun place to work for. Great for getting your foot in the door for such a large corporation. Food menu's change everyday you'll always be intrigued with what they have to offer. Awesome staff! The job is not to hard to figure out and comfy work chairs. Training is 2 to 3 days nothing to crazy. The hiring process was amazing. I feel like they really care about their part time employees. Amazon is a fantastic company to work for. Everyone is super nice and leadership actually cares about your well being. However, they use a third-party to set accommodations, and Amazon is not great at working to figure something out that suits both them and the accommodation need. happy to be employed, management is very respectable and fun to work with, employees are all different so you learn alot about different people and cultures Pretty good! the up to date technology is par, and the leaniantcy of the managment is ok. the breaks should be longer since the commute to the break room is such a far commute in such little time, but its alright! the job is fast paced, but not stressful, it's physically demanding, it takes a few days to get used to. it has good days off.it offers good benefits. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. If you're single, th savvy and are good with people, then Amazon is a great place. The culture is subjective though and if you don't fit in you won't make it. This is a great company to work for, the hours are decent, the only thing wrong is the constant shift change. It hurts every employee, sacrificing things we have in our life Fun place to work, but everyone gets paid the same amount per hour which isn't fair to those of us who work a lot harder than others.  Management is good, easy to talk to or go to with concerns. Overall a great starting job with great perks and people to work with. Can be overwhelming at times but overall good. Company pays well and provides good benefits to their associates. 4 day on and 3 day off is Great! I started taking calls the minute I got to work and it never stopped. Customers were rude and vulgar at times bordering on abusive. We were expected to take the abuse. A good place to work if you like being on your feet and being busy. Paid every week was nice. Managers very nice to work with. You need to ask if you can be trained in other positions that you were not hired for. On call 24/7 as a 1 person team overseeing issues from employees stealing to trying to commit suicide. If you don't answer your phone prepare for poor engagement surveys. Talking to employees who are suicidal with no training leaving most in very confusing difficult situations. Poor management with poor training. Managers were not trained to actually train team members. It was hard to learn anything from people that didn't know what they were talking about and changed their minds every hour of training because they misinformed you. I believe I was fired due to my medical issues.  I believe they only care about your productivity.  If medical conditions interfere with that they will find a way to terminate your employment. This job is not for everybody but it if you like a challenge and like to be apart of a team this is the place you want to be. There are certain systems in place that set you up for success within the company just ask questions. Clock in. Start-up meeting. Get to work. You're being timed. You will be questioned about time spent between end of start-up meeting and first scan. I learned that I was disposable and was of no worth to this company. I could have 30 good days of hitting rate all day long but one bad day and I 'd be questioned about my performance or lack there of. Management is just as disposable. Watched them come and go. Switched to night shift on a dime because it benefits the company. No concern for family life. The hardest part of going to the job was going to the job. The most enjoyable part is clocking out. All I can say is that I never thought people were serious when I said Amazon doesn’t care about their employees… But over the last couple of months I have definitely seen what people mean. Looking for a new job because I can no longer handle the overworking and the lack of appreciation. Good Job But They Could Use New Bosses & New Rates Also They Could Do More Fulltime & Less Seasonal WorkThe Pay Is Great & The People Are Ok Up & Downs Amazon is a fast paced workplace. I am always busy so that makes the day go by quicker which is great beacause who doesn’t like a quick work day. The shifts are great with my daily schedule. Near the holiday, amazon was great for overtime. Some of the managers do not know how to talk to you.  It is a very fast paced job. It is also very relaxed. About as bad as everyone says it is. Head managers sit on their a*s and don't know how to do any of the hard work. Run by morons. Constantly underpaid and expected to provide top quality work. Unrealistic expectations AND no bathroom breaks (Time Off Task) provided to 'help' the workers. If you’re not willing to work hard, fast, and accurate it’s not the place for you. You must reach certain goals for certain jobs. If not, you will be retrained and warned. So you have to keep improving performance. Given the high demand of production needed to keep up with incoming packages, management was not as adamant about getting a respectable output from everybody, nor would they assist in busy times. I worked night shift when I began and then the earliest shift afterwards. The night shift was usually shorted on hours because they day shifts would be overworked. The amount of people means there are a variety of types of workers. A lot of talking is done when work is priority. Harder workers are frequently moved around to compensate for slower producers and given no incentive to do the complementary work. Despite upcoming changes in pay, the benefits are lacking for most employees that are part-time with no discounts and few reward programs given the demand of the business provided. It’s  a job at the end of the day. Sure it’d be better if we got paid more but I guess that’s about to change November 1st... it’s still a pretty chill job. The holiday season begins around black Friday for their employees. They will hire a bunch of temps for the whole month of December and offer extra overtime as well but you cannot work more than 7 hours there. The pace is crazy all the management cared about was meeting quota for the day. The break was cut short numerous times so that we could get back to work. If you don't have a job this is a good option but I wouldn't recommend doing it long term especially if you reside in a warmer climate area. The heat can be overwhelming at times. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. The job itself was stressful. You get calls from angry customers who are hard to make happy (especially around christmas time) The management was friendly and super helpful! The training doesn't take long and the job itself is easy to grasp and get used to. Dont work here unless you need the job. The richest man in the world (aka the CEO) does not care about your progression or growth. You are better off becoming a server at a restaurant. The job is fast paced and the coworker are nice the management team does their job really well, biweekly pays are always a plus . The benefits are solid ! Recommend Amazon was an amazing company that I wish I could've stayed with while completing my internship hours to graduate from FIU. I would recommend anybody to apply to their company the work environment there is amazing and the people are amazing also I would go back and would recommend employment to everyone. The problem I had was with a one person in upper management and I cost me my job the job that I loved. Looks good from the outside but is a mess internally.  Lot's of politics and in-fighting.  The company appears to run by constantly bringing in new talent, burning them out, pushing them out and hiring a fresh replacement from an seemingly endless pool of applicants. it was a coo lil job they stress a lot about your rate. if you dont meet your rate they give you a write up. after so many write ups they eventually let you go. - Smart coworkers - Great perks: atmosphere, energy, compensation - Fun, with the right mindset- You will be challenged to conceptualize problems through alternate lenses- Management: Disconnect  at each level of leadership- Work/life balance - Expectations: Delivered at what cost? If u want fair treatment and good management, Amazon is not for u with the favoritisms and petty supervisors, and the making of new rules as they go to benefit them. I truly enjoyed this job. It was a fast-paced job that trains you in every area. The health grade incentives amazing health care package. This is a job everyone should work cuz it's so much fun to actually go to work. The role was a very fast paced and repetitive environment. One of the many great things about Amazon was its diverse culture.  They hired all walks of life from veterans, the disabled to the retired. Amazon took very well care of their employees. I enjoyed the brief time i worked for amazon. they would occasionally provide meals to employees. Would recommend my friends to work there. I have been part of this company for 5 years now and never regretted it.  Like any large company there are hard times but work life balance is encouraged.  What I appreciate most is the flexibility to get work done.  Large project is given, the PM is typically given flexibility to get it done as they see fit. Although this can be a fun place to work, you really need to be careful what you say to managers and HR. Every single person that I knew that went to HR had it turned around on them. They treat you like your a bad guy and like they are there to make it harder for you. I went to HR one time asking them if I could leave because my pregnant gf had to take our other child to the ER, they told me to tell her to get an uber.... They act like they get offended when you ask for help and then they go around and tell the managers if you complain about them, resulting in the managers screwing you over the next few weeks. Happened to me and plenty of others during my time there. You've been warned... Its just a fast pace building having to move back and forth getting parcels off the line and taking them to their designated space. once you get the hang of it, it gets easier. tires you out from standing, but in general, it is an easy job to complete with great benefits and usually a stable position in order to get used to doing the job a certain way. its a good environment for you to meet different people and advance depending on work ethic. Line leaders and high powers do communicate well and assist in whatever you may be struggling with. Amazon Alexa team is adrift.  the team lacks both leadership and direction.  They demand high level performance with little or no direction about what this high level of achievement is for.  there is no direct correlation between the work and product.  there is a major disconnect between the technical staff, the engineers, and the software/ user interface developers.  Biggest major flaw is that their conventions change daily or weekly making continuous workflows impossible. As a process assistant, the job can vary throughout warehouses. Ideally trained to back fill any floor manager with the objective to keep providing work to fulfill the FC process. Everything was learned through situational training and experiences as there was not a formal description of what day to day job duties are like in each department; fill in the role type of deal. Growth can be difficult especially as other departments are favored than others and tenure can overshadow talent. i work nights. i learned how to sorts, labelling and how to work in a team the hard part is it's very physical labor intense and your assignment never rotate. I enjoyed working for this company. I think it’s a great place to work. Great place to work, just need to increase pay and this place would be ideal. I love amazon, I think it’s sure a great job. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Its needed for holidays when you have family to take care of. I would work here as a part time. This place is good for young people as well. Good company It was like going to a yoga class daily booty shorts strapless t shirts and nobody said anything about it . was like a strip club. The male supervisors never said a word about coming to work like a stripper. They loved it. The. Also if you were young pretty and small boobies you were given priority on the jobs. It was all about cheating to get your guotas met. Was a fast paced great job, I got overtime and good pay. The management treatment is great and you are able to advance with hard work and dedication, all and all a great place to work. My shift was from 5 am to 10 am and everyday I never had a reason to complain about the time, because they kept me busy, but also kept it friendly. I would walk in and it would be like its in the middle of the day. All managers were upbeat and helpful and so were most of my co-workers! Honestly, not many complaints besides some facilities need a better A/C system and when loading packages onto vehicles, vehicles should accommodate for the fact that we have to arrange heavy bags while bent over. This can cause serious back problems, but other than that it would be a good job ! It is a great place to work, if you like to stand on your feet all and day and prefer hands on jobs. Every quarter you automatically get 40 hours of PTO. You have a  different job everyday and  it does not get boring, great atmosphere Amazon is very fast paced, non stop and stressful. This is coming from someone who was promoted in less than a year to assistant manager. I was let go due to to wrongful termination. amazon pays well for the work you do. they can be very competitive. constant work and constantly standing. somewhat physically demanding. overall not bad The calls were easy to take, and there was always a manager available to help with any issue. Job was fairly easy to catch on to. Weekly meetings were very helpful and helped to keep everyone on task. La empresa es muy buena y con mucha seguridad. Lo único malo es que no tienes un jefe directo cuando trabajas en el wharehouse.Y que solo buscan empleados para part-time, poco usan trabajadores fijos o tiempo completo. I found myself all too frequently cleaning up after other peoples' messes.absolute chaos. not worth your time. my opinion is likely skewed though because i wasnt eating right at the time. as in at all. but to be fair, that was mostly because of the hours. The Amazon campus feels suffused with enormous ambition to be or do something or anything, fueled by the breathless, unquestioned assumption that Amazon has succeeded because its employees are in some essential way better than those at other companies.This ego pervades the organization, but at their desks? I never met a more insecure, anxious, and coldly calculating crew of sophomoric billionaire-wannabes. The explosive growth of Amazon relates to technology and supply chain advances that were coming either way; Amazon was just a company, in the right place and at the right time to become history. It did not generate these advances, but the staff think they invented progress, and it shows. The overconfidence translates to ego and a particularly vicious and cold workplace realpolitik that would make Attila the Hun blink.It is a young company, filled with professionals who know enough to do remarkable things but do not know enough to ask themselves whether they ought to do those things, just because they can. There are so many things that technology can do for us; Amazon staff don't pick and choose, they just do. People work from home a great deal, call in sick a lot, and spend a lot of time conversing in meetings where the gist is that this marketing stuff is sophisticated hard work but we're ruling with our latest sprites, so, like, good, and better, see.Everybody is looking for their next position; newcomers are competition to be feared; a desk is a coveted asset. The fear of being demoted to hoteling stalks all.It is hands down the most soulless place I have  ever worked. Great pay, 4 days on and 3 days off. 10 hour shifts, Plenty of voluntarily overtime during peak season every once in awhile Mandatory overtime. When it’s slow and there is no work they will give vto (Voluntary Time Off) but you don’t have to take it. It's a fast paste environment. The day goes by quick since you keep yourself busy with work. It's quick money and you get great benefits and 3 days off. Well the short time I was working at amazon could have been the most memorable due to the fact that I worked along side some great people and area managers, even though I was a contract associate there wasn't a day they made me feel like I was full time employee and nothing less but the one and only complaint I have and is probably the biggest by far in my own eyes is a Maintenance aptitude test that 80 percent does not apply to the Maintenance department due to amazon sub contracting all the major electrical work out ..... not saying the people in Maintenance dont belong there but the people like myself who worked there buttoff to get where they are without schooling but doing hands on training day to day for the past 10 years and fail a test twice because I dont know the correct terms when it come to electrical but can and could do the work just like everyone else and without warning out of a job so that's the 1 and only complaint......... The work is not bad. I enjoy working here get to meet new and different people. They offer different positions to move around in. It is fast pace, sometimes fun, great learning experience. I love the atmosphere and co workers, easiest job ever, quick interview, loved the job, Love the benefits in the pay,  I recommend this job to anybody I dont know if there really was a typical way to advance.  Or else you had to slave in a blue collar position with the blue badge for more than i cared to, even with my engineering degree I would say the shifts they have there are very flexible. So if your looking for a good part/time job or even a full time job, Amazon is the right place for you. Lots of benefits and the paid time off was great. The work schedule was good with 4 days of work and 3 days off. The pay is great and the job is easy. Amazon gave a lot of lip service to putting you in a suitable position and working to your strengths, but instead falsly advertised what positions would entail to make it sound like it would fit your strengths, even if it doesn't. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Was a packer, 3rd shift was OK job.  Not a lot of chance to advance in timely manor.  Only once per year were you able to apply to change shifts or  job function.  If no degree, had to work there 3 years to go into management. I had a very bad experience at Amazon it was very long hours on my feet I asked for a special accommodation of extra two 15-minute breaks per shift they told me to get a doctor's note 2 have a special accommodation okay so I got a doctor's note I brought in the note and immediately they took me out of work telling me I was unable to perform the job I was out of work for a total of a month . With no income I finally was called to go back into work after the holiday Rush was gone all the overtime pay was gone I got back to work and they constantly harass me about my production and told me if I wasn't up to par they would get rid of me too much stress for me I went back to my old job at a different company Ability to own your role. I’ve never worked somewhere that provides so many resources to employees to do their job and trusts them to do it in their own creative way. You want to wear sweatpants to work and a t-shirt? No problem, Amazon wants you to be comfortable. Your team supports you and you aren’t competing with each other, you’re being the best at your job you can be while supporting each other. Productivity is a vital source in continuim of employement, the faster the better consistently. The management is very supportive in suggestive measures to improve. in amazon we work very organized and quiet. In amazon you can work 20 hours per week or maybe 30 hours per week depending on the schedule you have assigned. many people work in amazon to have extra money. It is a quiet job that you can do after arriving from another job. My job was to classify the packages by area using the scanner. Amazon provides everything that I could want in a job. Amazon have some of the best benefits on the market. Amazon also looks out for the employees and customers best interests. a really fun place to work at a fast pace and always busy. a typical day there is scanning boxes and stacking them on a pallet. then after you fill up a pallet you wrap it and ship it. -12 hour work days usually 4-5 days/week-managing a team of hourly associates -main tasks include: motivating, mentoring, and coaching your team-ensure your team has enough tools to set themselves up for success The small time I spent at Amazon was somewhat overwhelming and felt like a High School environment to me as far as the employee's go. It's an easy job to do as long as you stick to your goals and try to make them or surpass them. Overtime is basically mandatory and as someone who just isn't a fan of late night shifts in general, it's pretty grueling to be a Picker from 6pm-6 or 7am.Weekly payment is nice but for someone who wasn't absolutely in need of that kind of job, it wasn't for me. Very monotonous. Easy mindless work for decent pay. Breaks every two hours, weekly pay, choice to work alone or with a group, friendly coworkers, overall a pretty decent place to work. Amazon is a terrible place to work if you desire any chance of advancement. They require you to go above and beyond but only offer a select few associates the opportunity for these chances. That way when you go to interview for higher positions you are left struggling with stories to tell them of your accomplishments. It is a way to limit who can advance while showing the rest of the company that the opportunities exist.     Most of your job will consist of mindless work that will drive you absolutely crazy. This is a company that will use you for every ounce of labor it can get and then discard you. You will almost never hear management compliment anything you do and the longer management works for Amazon the less they care to say anything positive. Part of the problem is the higher up you are in the company, the less likely you are to have ever worked any of the warehouse functions. This leads to managers that have no clue as to what your job actually consists of and leads to ridiculous expectations and/or lack of encouragement and recognition.     Overall this company will use and abuse you for as long as you can meet the demands of your jobs. If you are lucky you will get out before sinking into some soul sucking black hole that leaves you dead to the world. For a part-time job it was really good! I got paid $14 and received benefits! Super relaxed, I was able to work in sweats! You have the option of 3 shifts: morning, day , and night. You might not get the shift you want, but you can change it later on. Amazon is a good place to work lots of benefits and discounts but the place is a very busy environment so be prepared to work a lot. Sometimes it could be overwhelming but you meet a lot of great people and management is great. great place to work, great benefits, great workplace atmosphere, great paid time accrual. great work app to make changes to schedule be it pto paid time off etc. Poor Management!!! They breathe down your neck and nit-pick at every little thing! They find any excuse to write you up and put you at risk to loose your job! You're not allowed to talk or laugh without them wanting to know why you're talking and swear up and down you're stopping and talking and wasting time! All they care about is numbers, scan rates to be exact! if its not 130 then you're at risk of getting written up!!! Amazon management was overall very rude and careless. Safety was an issue around the loading dock and there was rudeness from other workers. The other workers would often slack off and leave the majority of work to the hard working few. I Enjoyed To Working At Amazon. It Was Fun And Exciting. It Was Different And Creative To Help With Employees With Any Type Of Situation. I’m Not To Sure How Flexiable They Are With Schedules. I was a part-time evening employee. I would clock in by 9:00 pm; usually, we did not know what time we would be leaving.  It depended on the work load that day.  However, most evenings we would leave between 11:30 pm and 12:15 am. I learned quickly that there were little opportunities for job advancement.  The hardest part of the job was the temperature.  I understand that it was a warehouse, but I would be drenched in my own sweat after an hour of work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that we got paid every week. amazon was cool, I just didn't like the fast paced environment. I also didn't like that they made us work super hard and not pay enough. I also didn't like the management and the long hours Amazon Is a good company to work for. Everything quick and fast and you must be able to keep up. Management was not on point, you basically had to train yourself and learn how to work with using robot.s An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. A usual day on the warehouse consist of receiving and placing product on shelves. The managers have high demands for you, as you are expected to meet numbers. if you don't rank up on the top 75% you are terminated. Worked/ treated like a slave.  Bad management, very short breaks. Low pay, very fast paced. Hard hours, heavy lifting, very loud from all the machine. A prison system with higher pay. Quick-paced job, very competitive, but good pay. Enjoyed working there and the work was enjoyable. The pay and managment were great and made the job easier work was hard and when you go on brake they would count your walk time to the break room. manager suck never could find him when i needed help. however he always found me if they had a problem by stating it in front of everyone. A typical workday consisted of a meeting for 10-15 minutes before starting at the conveyor belts. I learned a lot about the mailing industries. Management didn't really seem professional at all, they would date their employees or hook up with them on a daily basis and everything was just rushed. You were overworked for bad pay. The best part about the job was that my best friend and I applied around the same time so we were both able to work together in a way and encourage each other throughout the shift. Repetitive Standing and manual labor in a warehouse setting.  Mostly a box factory with numbers and metrics to abide by...Not a bad job for someone just starting in the workforce and capable of doing manual labor. Inefficiency of management and no advancement! but for the rest, in terms of benefits and salaries, all are great. Corporate Culture are somehow weird. Never say hello to people other department. I guess it probably is just being Seattle. Great place to work if you enjoy a fast-paced environment and in need of some extra pocket cash. Management very reasonable and accessible. Fun Place. I liked it there lots of over time, very fast pace have to pay attention and do your job. Lots of benefits and perks although some people don’t like it I really did. But it was temporary for me peak season is known to make a few people pass out You may be stuck working one position when you're told that you'll work various positions. Benefits are great. When I work at amazon I got paid 12 an hr not 15 (sad face) Typical day when you're in the singles packing department, you're pushing numbers all day at a high rate. There's a very high chance of developing a permanent work injury in this environment so you need to be able to pace yourself accordingly. It's a business, no one is anything but a number. If you're interested in figuring out what a warehouse is like and how to run a business, this is a good place to figure things out. The work culture isn't too bad but you can't interact with people much due to everyone having their own responsibilities and the way everyone was isolated. Hardest part of the job was amount of intensity you had to apply on a consistent basis. The most enjoyable part of working here was fighting for voluntary time off amongst coworkers. Rediculous rates , managers are reading off of computers all day , break times are unfair , the only time i feel appreciated and when they hand out free merchandise and food. Elite leaders and processes.  Loved the people and loved the endless opportunities to develop.  Travel is required for all managers which helps forge new, indelible relationships.  Great place to initiate one’s career in logistics, management, and/or transportation.  Hours are long and productive, as required.  Wish only the best for new employees! You had to work fast and safety to scan the work into the system and load stuff from off the truck so it could proceed to further actions of getting shipped go to work everyday and answr the phone calls that come in stock. The culture is fun and nice but you was required to work all holidays and they don't care what you have going on. Was always busy, rules were pretty harsh that you had to abide by. maintaining a perfect 'score' in order to stay employed there. Some people didn't care to do the questionnaire at the end of the conversation. Great culture Good pay. overall it provides excellent opportunities for many people and they also give you opportunity to grow within the company. Probably the best labor job you can work at. Liked managements coaching mentality for teaching employees and correcting employees.  Safety or employee welfare does not seem to be a big concern for Amazon, as employees go through security to leave the building but not to enter. Was a very good experience.I learn different position to get a satisfactory development.I was free to expose ideas about the possible increase in productivity.I thanks everyone, and I hope to work again with them. Very Great anviorment with great people and great pay/benefits. they always tried to keep it a positive place to work. And were always doing things to keep you motivated An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. They raise your rate so you can't meet it, if you do meet rate they will say you haven't even if your scanner shows you've been above rate, working conditions don't improve and aren't important to the company. They also took away pay raises, stocks, and vcp. $15.00/hr is good but you will never move up. The work is easy, but physically demanding. You will walk 10+ miles a day. Peak season (Christmas) requires working 50+ hour weeks. You do not get holidays off. Had great benefits, no real job security. Amazon was overall not caring about us as employees. It was rough working there under the conditions of having to rush in everything we do. Injuries were bound to happen and they never cared. Amazon is what you make of it. Ive worked there almost 2 years and ive seen better days there. Not all your coworkers are trustworthy but thats anywhere. Like I said its all what you make of it. only if you like a military atmosphere not for me enough already what do you want to know?see what I mean they want you to write all this for what to make themselves look even worse Distribution warehouse. Including inbound loading, outbound sorting, pallet construction, pallet finalization, and pallet loading/unloading. Multiple shifts available for flexible hours. it is a fast pace environment. the culture is diverse yet with some flaws. the majority of the people are very nice. they are respectful and fun to work with. the management is good except for few people who treat their employees unfairly. -Problem solving via phone, chat, email, or all 3.-Great culture that is very accepting of those with differed levels of ability.-Management is typically supportive but there are those that are a bit more disengaged than expected.-Hardest part of the job is emotionally stressful interactions with customers.-Most enjoyable part of the job is helping hundreds of people and the sense of accomplishment associated with that.-Options to advance for socially fluent workers. The workplace was very conducive for the employees. You were given a locker, work gloves and a safety vest.My only problem with this part-time job was that I was not given notice when my shift terminated, and Amazon terminated my employment.  I received a phone call and was told that my services were no longer required.  I feel that this was not an effective way to inform an employee of their termination.  Amazon could have offered another opportunity to work on a different shift or another position within Amazon.I am very disappointed with my short employment at Amazon. I was only there 3 weeks.   I would not work at Amazon again. If you have a family, you will barely see them. Everything else was awesome though. Good pay. It was pretty hard on your knee's though. Especially if you are pregnant. Great people and environment to work in.They have a great no tolerance rule to fighting which I loved.Diversified community and all excepted.Great PAY FOR PART TIME EMPLOYMENT! Poor management and poor moral of employees, they hire alot of inexperienced managers that do not  have people skills. I feel because you do not have a degree does not make you unqualified for a management position. Worked hard for 4 years did almost everything when it came to applying for a upper level tiers I kept getting shut down basically favoritisms. I would help different departments  with back log clear it up and keep it minimum to none and still no recognition. Why work hard when you don’t get notice for it..  only when they need you. Lack of management they always come and go. They work you for rate and quality for what they are paying you. If you can’t make it. They hand out write ups like candy.  Loved it at first but when they decided to take away stocks and monthly bonus, with a 1.50 raise it’s not the same amazon from when I first started. Long shifts but fly by quickly, benefit hours are yours to use at your own digression. Awesome benefits with 401k. Two paid 15 minute breaks. Fun place to work but can be tough at times. The work of picking is good but i feel they should give more time for you to get your speed of picking where they want it . other then that it fun . Also why do they only hire picking or packing . They don't let you apply for anything else unless you've been there a long time. It was ok for temporary work, not to make a living. Management was horrible. They never showed up for work. Never there when you need them. A teenager would probably enjoy the pay rate, not a full grown adult. Firstly as an employee of Amazon we were told specifically NOT to say anything bad about the company to 'outsiders' and OF COURSE they WILL deny that, however A LOT of the Youtube stories about people losing their jobs for going to the bathroom (Time Off Task) and what they had to do are true. The company claims to be 'customer Obsessed' meaning that you will be reprimanded for NOT being at your assigned stations, IF you have to relieve yourself and it takes more than 5 minutes you WILL be reprimanded NOT at all considering that some people walk slower than others and most restrooms are not closely convenient to everyone... I have to remind myself that Amazon is a 'job' and NOT a 'career' because if U do not have a COLLEGE degree, you can only go but SO far. Management, are Usually hires with college degrees with NO leadership experience, and many have NO 'People Skills'... The BEST part of the job is that associates come from ALL walks of life and the bond and friendships we have working with one another. I don't want to sound unappreciative for Amazon has brought a lot of jobs back to Baltimore.. I thank them for that. I worked in a large sort center so it varies from locations and buildings so my experience can be different than others. You work long 10 hour shifts, sometimes 11-12 hours in a day if you get offered overtime that day. Some weeks you work 50 hours because of peak season (holiday season for Amazon). If you aren't in a lead/ management roll then you are in a rated function. You have to meet daily rates and if you fall under the daily goal you get productivity coaches and potential write ups and after a couple you can get terminated for not meeting productivity. You will be on your feet the entire shift which means you are constantly standing all day and sometimes walking 15 miles a day picking customer orders. You work in a really fast paced environment. Downside is the break and lunch times. You only get a 30 minute lunch and 2 “15” minute breaks which are actually more of a 10 minute break. There are multiple opportunities for promotion which allows you to go to different departments or even different building locations in other cities and states. They also have a program called Career Choice which allows you to go to school which Amazon pays for. They have great benefit options as well as 401K and Stocks (have you seen Amazon stocks lately!!!) I have met so many great people while working for this company. Worked there for a few months. Worked in the shipping dock area where primary job functions included loading trailers with amazon packages. Always got my 8 hours with opportunities to stay longer 15 hr days on your feet the whole time. Job did not feel rewarding. Was consistently wanting managers to come up with improving the business without spending money. This was an impossible task since the equipment was out dated and would break down constantly. DID not get treated equally with other managers. I was not a go out and party with other managers type. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. If this had been 30 years ago,I would still be there.But being older ,some exercises are not as simple to execute than when I was in my teens.But I was fortunate to work for an otherwise great company. The place was clean work friendly great team work good benefits and excellent management. I worked as a.picker and a packet and sometimes I loaded trucks I worked in multiple positions. I have no issues or complaints about this company.  The organization is a great place. Room for growth within organization.  Must be reliable and dependable. A typical day at Amazon consisted of 2 and half intervals of straight work before your first break that is only 15 minutes long. The next 2 and a half hours feel like the longest and your lunch break is only 30 minutes long. I know warehouse jobs are tough but if you ask me the 1 hour of combined break in 10 hour shift is a bit rough. I'd much prefer an hour lunch and skip past the 15 minute breaks that aren't long enough to even get from your mod to a break room before you're back at work for another 2 hours. That being said they had some amazing rewards for people who didn't use their paid time off, and the benefits they offered where top notch. AMAZON has the best customer service practice ever out of my 30 years in customer service. Amazon gives you the tools to cater to the customer. The company needs to become more family oriented for the employees. Hours should be more flexible. Team mates should be able to trade schedules.  Amazon should provide the CPU for the WFH employees.The wages are not competitive. I had to find a better living wages in order to survive. Work In-home contract basis. Average 2-5 work orders per week. No benefits on any kind. I would like to pick up more contracts in the near future as the schedule is very flexible. Amazon is no for employees who are hard worker. they don't deserve you as a best employee. Rather to go to other company with the same benefits. I pesonally will be losing $5,000.00. This company is for the young ones who want fast money and doesn't care to have quality workmanship. Leaders are not well experienced. Management don't know to motivated the employees or laborers. A typical day at Amazon was like a day of working out at the gym. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the labor Working at Amazon was good I would greatly recommend it to any close friends. Even though I was pregnant while working, co-workers didn't let me carry heavy thing's until I started showing then I was successfully transferred to a table with other pregnant females working all we had to do was wrap glass items etc. into plastic bubble paper and stack them into small boxes, later we would wait for someone to come and bring new pallet work for us. Had left home early because I was not feeling to good, which I'm glad because exactly 2 hours later my water broke which I lasted 15 hours in labor. Working there was extremely fun. Enjoyed working with everyone on my team and a few friends I knew before also work there. I wish I didn't leave, could easily say I regret leaving. Well it's in the past and I can't change it. I'm still on good terms with them and enjoyed every second working there. I have worked in an office for more than 10 years, I applied with Amazon thinking I would be able to move to an office position. I am having a hard time just getting an interviee. There are so many applying for the same positions. I believe this position would be great for experienced and inexperienced interns alike. I was surprised with the amount of responsibility they gave me. it was a very fun experience working there. i love amazon protect the forest wildlife. dab on the haters. go for world peace. love everyone. have fun and love. Good place to work. Had a great time getting to know all about Amazon and the people that work there. Plenty of exercise picking merchandise using rf equipment. Would not recommend to somebody with a family to care for unless you plan to move to managment. Would not recommend if you have any disabilities. They will mark whenever you use the rest room and if you go to many times in an hours they will try to terminate you instead of working to give you an accommodation closer to a restroom Amazon is now offering us as ISS $15 and we are happy with that. I am now a packer and is not much overtime for back half crew as of right now. We are expecting a lot of overtime for peak season 10 to 12 hour work days, it is a good starting job, be willing to work hard for extended hours and have unreal expectations set by the company. Things may have changed since I left; however I have to base my review on my knowledge. Amazon Warehouse Is A Great Place to work around the Christmas Holiday, I got hired on the spot at a temp agency in Phoenix, called Integrity Staffing Amazon's goal is to be the most customer-centric company on the planet.  This goal comes at the price of the employees.The people and benefits are great but, the rules are not.Once you step foot into the walls of the facility you are a machine based on the computers tracking you every second of your 10 hour day. Great people, helpful with new hires, great benefits and perks. Many different shifts, 4 hours. Can grab more hours anytime you want. Highly recommend An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Amazon had excellent managers that aimed to help me better myself not only as an employee but as a person. Best work environment I have ever been a part of! In DMI3, Miami, FL, I experienced the overworking of dozens of elderly people in the 12am-5:30am sortation shifts. I stopped requested time off on my amazon hub due to a strep throat infection only to be terminated withing two days. I would love to return to Amazon, but unable to because I was terminated. The management needs to be addressed. I loved what I did but found it difficult to get everything done in an average work day and ended up working long hours. I also found because of the long hours, I did not have very much time with my family Long hours spent moving around on your feet with frequent required overtime. Good pay, benefits, and advancement opportunities. However I would not want to make it a full career. No one was on the same page and I have never felt more like “just a number” in my whole life. Having a box thrown into my face and breaking my glasses was the last straw for me. I would not recommend this job Amazon is a good place for single moms or people who need certain times of the day off. It's very fast paced though. If your not used to moving and keep moving for 4-5 hours constantly it may be tough. But you can adjust. I would keep myself busy. I was working with a company on building their new warehouse in Salem, OR. My duties were to operate lifts and other heavy equipment to build racks. Work for the most part drags on. It's the same task over and over day in and day out. Standing on the concrete floor or using equipment that bounces slightly all the time I'm pretty sure has done damage to my feet. The management culture is always upbeat and promising 'chances to move up in the company' but there never seems to be any. Moving up is hardly a pay raise either. During normal days you would be there for a two hours shift maybe less. During holiday season they keep trying to let some people leave using VTO (voluntarily time off) and have the few remaining complete the job. Packages everywhere on the floor and on the belts. No one follow the roasters. everyday changes - work/life balance poorCompany continues to grow and more opportunities are becoming available throughout the network. Focus on managers to help develop and retain future leaders. You will work hard, but it can be rewarding work!  The management is fair, but have allot on their plate and rely on supervisors for alot.  Peak can prove to be quite a challenge. Management was not good at Amazon, i learned to drive a RC and double jack forklift, met good co workers while  worked there, worked in warehouse deals customer returns checking items for fraud and broken items, hardest part of the job was dealing with managers and i enjoyed the raffle giveaways and entertainment the company gave to us. - Receive packages on conveyor belt; scan the package and palletize on specific pallets.- Can wear jeans or shorts that are knee length; T-shirts are acceptable and preferred as the work is tiring. Personally, I loved my Job.Hated having to move to Brownsville only ending up back in San Antonio 2 years later looking for a great opportunity for employement with Amazon.Amazonian for Life ! the work is not so heavy because there are good companions.good schedules for those who study. give prizes to encourage us.they help us improve. they wants us to grow inside the work.they make many changes. Very   unfriendly environment work work work vro at the end of peak season will have you broke unless you want to stand around and do nothing for 10 hours. it Has good benefits but I would not work for The warehouse again no career advancements. It’s easy to get fired from the job and I would not recommend my family or friends to work there Amazon is proud of it's fast paced competitive environment, they promote high ratios and recognize employees with the best numbers.Overtime available specially around holidays At Lakeland, FL location, packages can weigh up to 50 lbs.  Lifting, pulling and pushing packages for 10 hours per day gets physically painful.  Not all locations have packages that weigh this much and some locations have packages that weigh more and require using fork lifts.  Before committing to employment, be sure you know what type of merchandise is at the facility and that you can handle it.  During the 10-hour shift, you stand.  Get shoes that have good cushioning and are at least a size larger than you normally wear.  Your feet will swell into them as the day goes on.  Many changes are going on and communication with non-management staff is slow.  Often we hear of changes on the news rather than from management. I worked there and it was okay pay I was 20 with not much to pay for but management sucked and I had to end up leaving because they wouldn't give me bereavement because I had missed too much. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. A typical day at Amazon meant clocking in at 7:25 am, starting with finding out where the manager has placed you for the day, in the case of me, i would either pack or go one of the indirect roles at the warehouse which meant being a waterspider (stocking boxes for packers). I would get two paid 15 minute breaks at 10 am and 3:15 pm, paid, and one half hour lunch break, unpaid at noon. After my final break i would continue to work until 6 pm and go home. I learned how the shipping process works, and how inventory was kept track of. The management was great in the departments that I worked for. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Amazon was an okay place to work, I felt over worked, under payed, and definitely underappreciated. They hired en mass so you knew you could be replaced in an instant. Bathroom breaks aren't a thing because you have 6 minutes before you start to accrue 'Time off Task' and too much, you can be fired. It takes at least 6 min to get to a bathroom in the facility because of the size. 10 hour days with 2, 15 minute* breaks and a 30 minute, unpaid lunch. *Scan to scan 15 min. so by the time you get down 5 min has already passed and it takes 5 more minutes to walk back, so essentially you get 5 min. When working at an Amazon warehouse expect long physically and mentally challenging days. The company expects their workers to maintain a certain weekly rate which causes adds an unnecessary amount of stress to an already stressful environment. The pay is okay but for the amount of work that we do I believe that we should be paid more. Make friends with whoever is in charge of bringing you work, otherwise you'll never survive as you won't receive enough work to complete your daily numbers. Great company to work for with good stock options. Great medical, dental and, vision coverage. Get assign special projects to help elevate your advancement in the company. Stocks growing fast use to be a picker then I went to the ship dock was doing tdr load trucks and drive the folk lift . I didn't like to pick cuz I walk to many miles feet use be sure.. had fun driving the forklift fast and I loved my cowokers No one really had controll over anything. Workers always complaining. Hours werent matching. Lunches werent correct.. Always blaming drivers with craxy situations Working at the kiosk is great. It's a small, but effective team. If your a part time worker its hard to get a second job unless its strictly overnight because the shifts fluctuate every week. But its great if you are full time. It a hard job to keep rate. It also a great job to work at. You get paid every Friday that what I like about the job.and one more thing I like working overnights. Good job for extra income or people with no serious bills to pay. Can work up to 60 hrs a week during peak seasons and about 30 hrs during non peak time. Working at Amazon, there really is no such thing as typical. Delivery trucks can arrive late or early. You never know what your day will be until you are clocked in and the area manager tells you about the day. job requires a lot of walking through 2 block long factory, so it can be bad on your feet. Team leads and management wasn't as helpful at explaining things which i usually will learn things quickly. i will run the line sometime i will also pack items in make sure they are ship off.i also did forklifting operating moving pilots uploading in unloading trucks Work was usually great. Long 12 hour days, Great pay and they are very understanding when it comes to having to call in for any reason. I highly recommend this job to all job seekers. You great work environment. Meet new people and sharing their experience helps you get a understanding of what to do and expect from the job and can be use outside of workplace. If you already have back  and or knee problems beware, this is a physical job.  Try to work smalls, semi-induct, or pulling smalls and scanning them  in with a scan gun. Very fast very exciting I thought working at this place was pretty cool the management and the time off was alright I didn’t mind it T all I hope to work here again I would like to be rehired at amazon i enjoyed working there the hours and the pay was just what i wanted and needed. i was laid off and was told I can be rehired but i relocated to Arizona All Amazon fulfillment centers should hire and have district/regional managers to look at the ups and downs on the warehouses. The work culture is extremely difficult having young inexperienced managers micromanaging long term veterans. Micromanagers can only speak out about 1/4th of the companies work policies and it's all about the productivity statistics. Area managers disregard other important work standards such as: work safety, employee communication, signs of urgency on associates' assistance and questions & concerns. With all the frustrating micromanagement issues surrounding the facilities, these results a higher turnover ratio from all associates, (HR, PA's, and Tier 1). It's not the Associates fault is they resign or terminated from the company due to unsafe working conditions, managers treating their employees unfairly by wrongfully writing them up for failing to meet quotas. If I was a district manager working for Amazon, I would be so busy making adjustments and changes with senior operations management team including all area managers first. Micromanaging associates inside a fast-paced fulfillment center is 100% unacceptable because it slows down productivity and creates a high turnover ratio. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. It's easy, fun and more experience I have learned working at Amazon. The supervisor and staff are very nice and they always helps you whenever you have any questions about work. They inspired you to work because of there positive attitudes towards to all the employers. Good learning experience and amazing production team! We all learn everything new each day. Peers get along very well. Everyone on the production team helps out one another. Working and building these robots has taught me so much. A difficult job for anyone seeking some sort of mental stimulation in their work dayThey don't care to hear what you have to say.Your feet will develop sores and blisters from walking the floor all day. Invest in good shoes. Amazon is a good company to work to work for. The job is done at a fast rate and all associates must work in accordance with company policy. They also have exceptional services that are provided for their employees. Decent job, but WELL underpaid. 401k is vested for 2 years.Also, they do not treat the production workers very well. The only good thing about this job was the health care package. Favorites with Managers you feel like modern day slavery. A lot of just standing not working, race card was definitely played.  Breaks too short for distance you walk to and from breakroo I was a Tier 3 Senior Yard Driver with the most OTR Driving experience  when I was hired. They hired new drivers that wrecked trailing and gave them senority over me ..just because the work on the floor at a different building.I was not treated fail. Mgr Put me on 3rd shift knowing that I my wife worked those hrs..I resigned from amazon as a Tier 3 ..I have experience on the floor,Logistics shipping and management. It became the worst experience at a job ever My experience with amazon was a great experience that really connected me with a lot of positive co workers and it expanded my employment experience and to be honest the only reason I stopped working there is because I had to relocate to Georgia but if I had the chance to get a nother amazon job I would jump at the opportunity Good place for everyone with good intent.Associates may be handy sometimes with respect to discharging their duties in terms of being organized and orderly.Team work ensues but sorting associate need be told organized system makes job much more intersting and fullfilling.I like the setup at Amazon and i believe it is a great company. pick items from shelves at a fast pace, pack orders at a very fast pace, drive a forklift through isles to replenish or stock picks locations. Each of these roles may be done separately Good place to work, but I have to drive two hours one way to get to work.  Wears and tears on vehicle.Delivery is an Independent Contractor.  Usually ony get one block per day. I just started working for Amazon for 2 weeks, already I had points/time taken away from me and its was my day off...Payday finally came and I still haven't received my check yet...So far just gave me the runaround...They want you to stow 188 package and hour...Who does that on their first night, manager yeld at me for something I had nothing to do with..Site has only 2 bathrooms 1 on each side and it's far from wherever you are...This job is only good for making extra cash or if ur looking for a job real quick for the time being....Other than that...Ehhh, it's ok to a point.... nobody was on your back very easy work long hours also long days nice people really didn't have a set manager but any manager you could really talk to Amazon was a great place to work, I was lucky enough to get into facilities, where you can advance and keep making more money, unlike inbound and outbound workers who top out. The only downfall of my job was that they kept promising that I could advance. I never did. The pay was okay, but when it comes down to your reviews and your waiting and hoping for that 1 big pay raise, It falls flat. I think in my eight years there, the biggest raise i got was .20 cents per hr. even with the miniscule raises, i was still making 20$ per hr.  The fellow associates I had were  great. Amazon is big on not bulling others, and big on no sexual harassment.  overall it was one of the best jobs i have had. It's a face paced environment. If you are flexible and depending on what department you start in, you can succeed in this company. It is definitely somewhere for someone just starting in the industry. Actually care about their employees and it was a fun interactive place  to work. Would love to work for them again. These are genuine people.Real connections, real people. Amazon will train you in everything. And they will hire you with absolutely no experience. But once you are trained, you are expected to perform as if you have been doing the job for years. The benefits are awesome but you have to make your self know to management or HR if you want to advance in the company. The environment is not very conducive to IT work because of the volume level in a warehouse.  You need to go in through a metal detector and most people aren't allowed to bring in their phones. Great place to work. Truly appreciated how much the company value process improvements. Feedback is provided in a timely fashion. Overall, best work experience of my life. Very rushed, always watched! Talent is not really appreciated or cared about. Its all about the numbers products you scan, how fast error free. It just was not for me. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. You'll sweat and stink every day there, making is rate king. You will be written up for not making rate. They try to be a pep rally kind of upbeat atmosphere but the physical demands will eventually get to you. Nagged to get back from breaks after every break, and very long walks to the bathroom if you need to use it which will affect your rate Ok first job or if you desperately need one but kind of treated like a child in their culture. The only thing that makes the job bearable is the 3 day weekends and even that catches up with you eventually. No a job for everyone. it was ok  I guess a very good second job if you ask me with a lil bit of hours. but that was back in 2016. time has change so I don't know how they run things now . Only really started for the pay checks, stayed for the fast-pace environment and long blister work outs where I was standing without breaks and working at the pace that they governed for me As long as you are prepared to work hard and not stand around and talk you will excelThere is opportunity to grow in any direction that interests you from truck driving to upper management A great opportunity to learn what it takes to sort and move massive quantities of packages everyday. I learned the inner workings of a sort center (order already packed) and how to lead a team of associates at one of the inbound areas. A typical day at Amazon's Warehouse was stressful. I dreaded going into the toxic environment and working ten hours on a overnight shift and not being compensated for much especially in a field I don't admire. A decent part time place to work. No career advancement opportunities. No raises for anyone. No full time positions ever become available in the warehouse Productive workplace. Fast pace and you are working closely with other people. Overall it is a very good place to work at Amazon. If you are looking for part work; Amazon is the place to be. Great if you are solely career focused. Not flexible to employee needs, business needs outways life needs. Can be a great company to promote through, however, you may also have to work nights for years and years. good place to work i really enjoyed it you work very hard on a production line package up items to send out to customers all over the world really enjoy working there Amazon overall is not a bad place to work, it can be a lot at times especially during peak. But overall its ok the benefits are good, the money is good and it can take a lot of things as far as your bills If you want to work, come there. It is fast paced, yet fun. You will find plenty of people to ask questions if you have any, and you will always have something to do. Indirect roles are a must to learn and work your way towards if you don't want to be stuck doing the same thing everyday, and so is cross-training into other departments. Some of my favorite days were working in other areas. For Some people, Amazon could be a great job. My main issue with it is that it is basically soul sucking. You walk at least 10 miles a day, picking random items off the shelf to put into a tote and send off to shipping. All the while having to maintain a rate of 100%+ to goal, which FYI they don't tell you at the beginning what they want you to pick at or what the goal is. Try to pick AT LEAST 125 items per hour. And for people who are sociable, this job isn't for you. You can get yelled at by management for trying to talk to someone. You are forced to pick fast and silent and pray that you don't have a terrible pick path, which they haven't revised at my location in 2 YEARS. And the silence gets to you. You're not allowed to listen to music, and they don't have any background music playing, unless you enjoy the sounds of heavy machinery. It really is true what they say: you are treated like a robot here, like just another cog in the machine. But like I said, it's not for me, but it might be great for you. Work suitable for young beginners with no physical limitation.Stressful and very fast paced.odd work hours.very parttime with scheduled hours from 4 to 6 hours . Enjoyed my work days at Amazon face pace environment and helpful people. Managers were always helpful and easy to talk to and the pay was always god and on time. job is very stressful they are always on your back about something even going to the bathroom. you have to have a certain rate no matter if your sick or not feeling good they don't care they give you a certain amount of time if you don't have any time to leave they wont excuse it and if your time goes in the negatives then you are fired. Amazon it's a place where you can learn a lot and is a very challenging company. Sometimes it can be stressful and frustrating but you can take the positive of all these experiences. Youll be sad :( They treat everybody like a number.The managers are rude as can be the have no appreciation for no bodyy and one they are done with you. curtains Was very fast paced always a lot of work to do to make sure that you were on top of things. They always wanted you working and. It slacking off. They wanted to keep you busy at all times. Amazon has great benefits and perks. The pay is not as great as it should be. However, it is a good start for some. You are able to move up quickly and they hire within. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Company gives you the ability to use your skills to the utmost. Atmosphere is very professional and the benefits are excellent, The company cares about its associates. It is a good place to start to introduce them to fast pace and stressful situations. Advancement opportunities are slow and have to outshine others. The culture there though is amazing, there are a lot of different cultures and everyone is a family. My manager was horrible didn't meet his workers needs,  barely had any shifts amazon has way to many workers and way less shifts available. Barely had any breaks Don't believe the news completely, it's not as bad as they make it out to be. You can get your steady 40 with little fuss. The benefits are a lot better than most other places in my area. manager made me feel incompetent and when I'd ask for specifics he'd shrug or go off on a tangent about something completely irrelevant. A lot of his answers or coaching never made sense to me. He would try to use his own experiences to 'guide' me but left me confused and scratching my head. not enough training, must be able to handle constant changes in workflow, management, and moving around a lot. I moved desks about 5 times, no warning. A typical day consisted of showing up, clocking in, doing a brief recap meeting to go over protocols, new details for the shift, and establishing the training already given. Management was determined to make sure everyone was on the same page. The workplace culture was a strict one, leaving little to no room for mistakes.Hardest part of the job was training for likely scenarios, emergencies, and protection of Amazon employees. Quiet job for those working graveyard shift Started out at $14.25 with a .50 cent to a .75 cent raise every six months. When the building is in retrofit or expanding it's a nightmare none of the contractors know what they're doing. Nobody communicates anything and IT is expected to pick up all the slack from everyone one else. I love the Ping Pong table. It was  great table with both a ping and pong. Me and the co-workers would ping and pong on the table all day and we'd laugh and smile. No OT offered. Constantly being asked to take voluntary unpaid time off due to lack of work. The new minimum wage benefit only benefits new associates or those making under 15 an hour. Anyone who has been with the company for 2 years or more, lost a lot of their yearly pay check.  Lackadaisical management. Promotions are based on a dog eat dog environment. New programs that are supposed to be an improvement for processes are riddled with errors which cause constant write ups for associates. The goal oriented monthly vcp bonus is now gone, leaving nothing to strive for. The disinterested associate now makes equal to associates who go above and beyond for customer experience. Enjoyed working at the warehouse.  The management is always helpful and available with answering any of your questions.  Competitive and also fun place to work. Horrible place to work. Constantly switching managers who know nothing of work hired to do. Always giving out negative feedback during slow times to get rid of veteran workers Working at Amazon is a very physically demanding job having to walk all over to get the items needed for your order you are filling. Packing a box properly so nothing is damaged. easy, fast paced environment, great pay, would love to go back, would definitely recommend.  I was a warehouse worker for a couple of months, I really don't have much more to say than what I have said. Hr are kids that have no degrees so it shouldn’t be called HR and you never know who your manager is it’s very fast paced I loved the mez sorting and packing honestly amazon is how I would run my company if I had one it’s just management and the ppl act like little kids in jr high so it gets annoying sometimes but I low key loved working there for the 3 days off just not the long hours I do not have any opinion about amazon. Amazon was just my place of employment. I do not have any thing to say for or against the company Amazon and associates. Amazon is a great place to work. Each department meets separately in the morning and stretches before starting your shift. Stretches are also done after lunch. Never work for Amazon, ever. The management doesn't pay attention. Human resources couldn't care less about employees. You're over worked and under paid and they don't care about your opinions. Fun place . not back breaking but exhausting . No room for flexibility with hours. you come in and know exactly when youll be leaving. Not the BEST with communication but Amazon does strive to hear everyone. It was an okay job but hours weren't very flexible and the job could get stressful at times. Lots of opportunity for overtime during holidays especially. Pay was great. The job was very easy to keep rate, the only downside was being on your feet for 10 hours a day. If you did other or harder jobs inside the facility you were not compensated or didn't receive any recognition from upper management. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Very hard on the body. The company does stretches twice per shift. Employees are given incentives to meet or exceed their goals with internal competitions. If goals are not met employees are given verbal or written warnings, retrained or notice of potential termination. The job leaves you sore from the second day and throws off sleep schedule and causes pain and soreness. You are not allowed to call out or go home sick. You are expected to meet your target rate no matter what is going on in your personal life or of any illness. There is little to no chance of changing positions or shifts. You meet a lot of people , make new friends and if you're good at what you do, you have room to advance if you're noticed. Paid training, which is good. You have to account for all your time while on the clock.  If you use the restroom it's time off task.  The bad thing is that you can leave early using unpaid time off. The workload increases because there's less people for the workload. Management sucksyou're supposed to complain to your PA than your manager But none of them fix anythingIt took them 6 months to get tdr what they need Work as pop up associate for seasonal job, very exciting and great team to work. Manager was excellent and open minded. Employees from other pop up store were very great to work. On district meetings everybody was nice and food was unlimited and the best. I would recommend if given a change to work for this company. A typical day began with an associate meeting, site updates, warm up and stretching, job assignments. The management was very engaging and participative. I had the opportunity to learn a variety of operations and skills. They encourage open communication and provided opportunity to offer input in all areas of the facility. The hardest part of the job is the rapid transition of the management team and constant change. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of teamwork and being a part of so much innovation. I like working. It was good hours and good pay. The people and the managers where so nice. When you needed help they would help out a lot. They took the Time to help out when need. They where ever  patient. Straightforward warehouse job.  Overall the job is not that difficult.  They have 30-minute lunches and 2 fifteen minute breaks a shift.  A lot of walking is required. Good place to work , steady job , co-workers are very helpful.be prepared to be on your feet 10 hours a day. Training is offer. Management always try to make it fun Amazon has a very quick pace to get packages sorted out for shipment. It can be very stressful for different areas and jobs. There is room for growth but it takes a little while till openings for training is  offered. Good and productive work place , very good part time job , flexible schedule , hr and managers very friendly and response to any task of any employee. Nice place to work.  Operated forklift and prepared orders for customers.  Was only a seasonal job so I didn't work there very long. Staff was always nice Not the best experience, but still worth working there. I wouldn’t stay in amazon as a career job, main reason it’s very stressful and too complicated with being able to rotate in different position/roles in terrible management. It was an okay exprience. It was a seasonal job so I couldn't really say much about it. There were times we were sent home early because the volume of the packages wasn't really enough for one shift. Management treated people and technicians as disposable commodities. Was not a happy work environment. I would like the opportunity to show Amazon how to treat technicians but I feel it would fall on deaf ears. It was a very friendly environment. The people were awesome and it was a great management team there that made sure everyone know how to do there job. Amazon is a great place to work. However,  unrealistic expectations must be achieved in an unrealistic time frame for an extremely Physical  position. Tried many times to advance but the management seemed to favor their friends for certain tasks. Lack of good communication within the management team. Worked here 2 yrs and only got a 25cent raise!  People make more working the drive-thru at Chick-Fil-A. Only work here if you hate yourself and have no education or job prospects and enjoy being talked down to as if you are a little child. All employees of Amazon will start off at 15 an hour regardless of location. And if you're already at 15 or more you will receive an increase. As far as retail goes Amazon is crushing the competition. It's a fair place to work. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Great people to work with Relaxed atmosphere. Team oriented, Fun people, Great management staff great people to work with Relaxed atmosphere. Enjoyed my time there, the staff and environment were quite nice. The management was also well handled and given. You have a lot of space for you desk, clean kitchen and workplace. The hours are actually fine. Of course you would old get customer complaints and all that but your team and team leader and manager are there for support. Amazon warehouses are very divided, poorly ran and lack effective means of communication and motivation. Employees are seen as just numbers and disposable to most of the management and there is an evident issue of favoritism and a lack of motivation for those who come to work to actually work rather than socialize. Its very hot in the summertime and the expected productivity levels are difficult to obtain without teamwork. There is a lack of policy enforcement and a false sense of job security. If you aren't cozy with the right people, your job will be difficult and stressful. The upper management cares more about making numbers than anything else. If there would be changes made to actually make employees feel appreciated and supported throughout the year, instead of just during peak season, and if everyone was treated equally, maybe those with good work ethic wouldn't feel like they're never going to see the benefits of working hard. If there would be an enforcement of policies and equal enforcement at that, maybe more employees would care about the quality of their work.There is much room for improvement and if the right people spoke up, if they felt like their voices would actually be heard, and if upper management would actually take the time to address the valid concerns and implement a plan of action, I'm sure things would get much better. The different roles need to be closely monitored for productivity, efficiency, and areas for improvement, even if that improvement means putting other people in these positions. You can;t really do anything other than your  job role unless you befriend managers and find a way to prove to them that you can do the job better than whoever is currently doing it and although they promise opportunities for advancement, unless you're friends with the right people, don't get your hopes up. I was fortunate enough to have a very kind and compassionate manager but she quit so I dunno if working here is even worth it anymore. A typical day at work is normal to me and is a Very nice environment and the workplace culture is health. The management come to interact and ask question If you want a career not just a job with the chance to grow than I would suggest here. For the time I was there I pick orders, package them, bring packers boxes, transport pallets of boxes, and some other jobs. There was nothing there that I would call difficult. Management was management they can be a bit pushy and even if you work hard if your numbers are not up to their liking they will let you go. Co-workers are the same everywhere you go. You got your good people then you got your personalities. Most enjoyable thing was three days of rest. That is if you're not working Christmas season. During the holiday times if very possible that you might only get one day off or none. A typical day at Amazon is very tiring we are over worked and under paid. The environment is very harsh you are expected not to talk even while working. Management will seperate you if you do so and you get written you for every little thing. When you approach managers about a problem it never gets resolved. I've learned not to give so much of myself to a company that doesn't care about me and my well being. The hardest part of my job is repetition on my body and the most enjoyable is my coworkers as I have worked side by side them for 9 years. This is a great company and the studio environment was inclusive. I enjoyed the contract position as it allowed me to learn about the culture and become one with the employee engagement initiatives created by my team. I could appreciate managements and H.R.'s efforts to increase work life balance and allow every employee to dive deep and explore their ideas. Truly interesting concepts and loved their leadership principles. A great guide for any companies mission to improve the employee base. Not up to date on the cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area and the tech industry. (This was for AWS, not a fullfillment center). Low pay but great training options and benefits. If you are starting early in your career, this is a great place to start. Overall, Amazon is always looking to get better at everything including work with its corporate employees to find the work life harmony.  I have learned a lot working here and would encourage anyone that wants to be in an environment where its fast paced, working with smart people, and is thirsty to develop.The hardest part of the job is finding the right balance.  There are always lots of request to complete things and not enough time to do it.  It is critical to have a manager that you can get along with. First time when i started working with amazon as delivery driver they use to pay me hourly 14 dollars , after two mounts they changed everything they started paying daily 130 dollars and they added more packages , so instead of 90 stops per day to 250 stops , that is the reason why i left this company. Everything you hear that is bad about working here is true. You are basically in a cement prison for 10 hours without human interaction. You can’t listen to music and the only sounds you will hear is the whirring of machinery. You will be in so much pain the first month and want to cut your legs off. Pay and benefits are great but that didn’t help me from spiraling into a major depressed state and wanting to throw myself into the conveyor. AMAZON- Smyrna, GA	     2018-PresentAssociateFacilitated management with maintaining customer’s commitment to Amazon by supporting the policies and procedures ensuring confidentiality, integrity & availability of customer’s deliverables.Interfaced with a myriad of information systems Develops and manages SOPs for process and quality assuranceOversee production processesOversee receiving processesOversee shipping processesMaintained 100% attendance rating not missing a day of workMaintained 100%safety rating for not being injured or injuring a fellow employee on the job They pay under what I think you should get paid there, also it is a very demanding job. They expect you have certain perimeters met, but when you bring up examples holding your area back, they tell you to just figure it out. Your treated completely unfairly. Asking to get cross trained is ignored unless you become an ambassador. If you become an ambassador theirs an easy chance you'll get fired. There is a whole lot of drama and nosy people so if you had a private life before, forget about it. Not a good working environment.  Its a sweat shop.....  turning and burning associates. All the making rate and pushing orders out.  Great from a customer stand point but not for employees.  If your soul is for sale you'll love it there. Work at Mc Donalds better benefits and pay. Amazon is a Whale and swallows up everything in its path to make more money. There is no reason why they cant pay their workers living wages I worked in Coppell, TX and had A supervisor that knew absolutely nothing about her job. She would catch an attitude and storm off when she was wrong. The job is also paid fairly if you are A student. No grown person with a family can live off $11 especially when hours are always being cut. To many boss they had me all over the place they watch you like you was a thief  they hire the most lazy people and the it people was they hated helping you I have use the Amazon it's it is wonderful and u love Amazon to buy some things it is use for me give some delivery charge free and give quickly to delivery the thinks Fast pace job. It was a clean place to work at. People was nice. They help you alot. The hours was great. it was a good place to work at.  They train you very well. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Working amazon has changed my life and i would love to work there again if they can give me another chance. I tried applied a couple time but they wouldnt moved forward with my subsission. Butg other than that. Amazon is amazing, busy and fast paced. Regional management and Site management can be horrible at times. If you have a good site lead your experience will be great. I was told if I don't marry my job I would not last long. I don't think Jeff Bezos really knows what happens to his employees in the warehouse (SC or FC) Don't have a review to reflect anything about Amazon.com  The Overall positioning was a fast pace experience and Ilearned alot from the company  and I don't have a hundred and 150 characters to give in this review I am also thinking of returning to the company for a third run I will try and give the job another chance hopefully more exciting thing arise from me doing so. There are definitely toxic managers there.  If you are unfortunate to get one, your life can be miserable.  Mine left me alone for 2 years but I did see many people come and go under this person.  Once I was 'targeted', that's when things started going really bad.  I started having health issues, miserable work life balance, and just a horrible experience.However, before that, I was a kid in a candy store!  If you like to hack, code, play in the Cloud, man this place has it all.  And, the culture has so many smart people it's just crazy fun.  If you're 20something, go there.  If you have a family/kids, go there...but plan your exit after about 2.5 years.  If you last longer, great.  But, that's not what Amazon wants.  They want turnover so know that. i have nothing to say i dont know if it is be a good company to work with ,, i did not like working there the manager was so races thaats its i,,,,,.,.,.,.,., it was not a bad as a job but management was not the best, A really big improvement needs to be taking place specially with third party companies working for Amazon. Its not a bad job just boring to be honest. You don't interact with barely anyone. Also the hours did not work for me. I worked from 6pm until 4am so I missed alot with my kids. went to work, had group meeting, went to my position of counting the merchandise in the bins, went home.  I learned that if everyone does there job well, you feel satisfied at the end of the day.  Management was willing to work with the details of what was expected of employees.  Even though it is a fast paced job, you can still have good quality of work.  Counting bins that are entered in the system wrong.  I got to count many different types of things that Amazon sold, in the warehouse I think that amazon is a horrible company.  I was not given enough hours with gasoline price.  I could not do scanning for food items.  You should have a sister-nun in charge instead. ups and downs, there where a few good workers, the others were slow or slacked up which puts more tress on the workers that work fast. The trailers are tremendously dusty and it can hurt the workers lungs in the long run. I worked there as a seasonal worker. I worked for three months from October to December. It was very fast paced and a little tedious to keep pace. Yet, it was great exercise and the people I worked with were really nice. I left amazon due to operations center going virtual. It was a great mistake, however. The company cares for their talent and there are endless advancement opportunities. job opportunities as far as advancement come depending on friendship with higher ups . also when it comes to managements in my experience favoritism has a lot to do on how your work experience will be Very competitive, fast pace.  Job is base on numbers.  You have to make the quota which means you have to work quickly.  I quess it is fun  for a eighteen or twenty year old. Great company (by reputation), horrible management. Amazon has an amazing set of leadership principles. The issue is that leadership warps those principles into a means of forcing the maximum amount of work out of employees. This went to the point of some employees committing suicide. That's when I decided to leave. If you want to make money and you dont value your time at all then I highly reccomend Amazon. It may be a warehouse but that doesn't excuse missing your holidays with your family, being chastised for normal behavior, and being treated like a disposable robot. Plan to work hard! Four 10 hour days, 3 days off are a nice blend. This is a transitioning position for me. Health benefits are worth the work - however, it's hard work and the pace is fast. You'll be busy here! You are overworked and underpaid.  This place slave drives people.  When you do get a break you don't have ample time to even actually have your full break because you have to walk so far you lose half your break in walking time not to mention you are working all 10 hrs on a concrete floor.  Also it was very hot inside the warehouse. Prepare to sweat and work your butt off and not get your full breaks to rest for a minute. I currently work for Prime Now, where we are stationed at our local Wholefoods, where we grocery shop for prime now customers. We have a two hour window to collect their items and then prep them in our stationed area, and from there a prime now driver then comes to pick the bagged items up and delivery them to the customer. It is very easy yet tedious, and I love working here. the company itself is a great company to work for providing all types of avenues to get into. the only thing that gets in the way of such a good company is having the wrong management working. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. The best thing about amazon is the benefits. great insurance plans. excellent time off options. high expectations on rates. low pay increases for senior employees. all managers seek  to write up associates for anything and everything including going to the restroom. Very fast pace of you like competition . You have to meet your rate Which you can meet easily if you work at a very good pace. I like it here. Come join the team! I had a seasonal position for this job. The workplace was hard to figure out. The higher-ups were very rude and didn't really care about you. I saw them fire people on the spot. Do not work there. If you get hurt they will kick you out. They do not care about you. Hard had work not worth the pay. Pay is under average for warehouse work. Working at Amazon was a great first job. It allowed me to get a good 11 hour workout in everyday while I was a Runner. The hardest part was the long hours ,but that was also one of the best parts of the job. judgmental and fast pace hard work with minimal pay and no organizational skills whatsoever to the company and its methods for job training and pay. Hard to speak to a ACTUAL PERSON if you have ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS. very fast paced job, a lot of people everywhere, a lot of waling, okay pay rate ,hardest part of the work day is short breaks, I learned how to stay efficient Some days can be intense, others not so much. If you can learn to work together with your co-workers it can be a fun job, but if you're there thinking you can slack off and get an easy check; you're gonna have a hard time. Work hard, play harder. I thought it was a good place to work but like any place it did have its issues but overall a great place to work. It offered a friendly environment but was very fast paced. I enjoyed working in one of Amazon's fulfillment centers as a holiday hire.  We usually worked 40 hour week, but the closer it got to Christmas we started working 50 hour weeks.  We were paid 1.5 for hours over 40. Management working to attain their team goals, no consideration for individual workers. People are considered expendable. Managers do not bother to learn peoples names, partly due to high turnover. Managers 'know it all' and won't listen to suggestions to improve processes and safety. Management does not seem concerned with a relationship with workers. Mostly focuses on productivity & discipline. Although highly important, not experienced with the fact that all areas of management is important,not just a few. Usually the case when companies hire from within. Having a Bachelors degree gives one the ability to use more than just long time with a company as your only experience in management. The other attributes a layman person would not be able to apply. Longtime workers do add loyalty and care for the company, but when dealing with co workers, can only apply job functions and rules, not much else. A manager with a Bachelors degree brings more to the table . Not that bad of a place to work.  In all positions I know of your on some type of 'rate' system.  Meaning keep up or there'll let you know or your out. Typical work day consists of 3-5 hours and 8-12 miles of walking within that time. You can choose to work 'doubles' which means 6-10 hours a day and 15-25 miles. Management varies. You're treated like a child until you've worked there long enough to earn their respect. They train you on whatever you want, but it's all just more responsibility and stress, yet the same pay.If you're working 40 hours a week at a dead end job at minimum wage, this job lets you make the same amount of money but working 25 hours a week instead. It's a step up until the job drains you of all feeling and you become an actual robot. They 'offer' all of these benefits, 'stocks' and that they can 'pay for your school', but you might be fired before you can even use these things.  One day i didn't make the rate and got written up, but my production rate for the week was still at over 120% to plan for the week.  They only care about you making the rate.Nearly 50% turnover rate of new hires by the end of the  first month. felt like a slave labor, above average compensation but still not enough for the toll it took on your psychemanagement was barely adequate, mostly young inexperienced people who were excessively and unrealistically optimisticmost everyone there was miserableyou have to work even if you're sick or injuredit was nice to be able to wear sweatpants and stuffno A/C I worked for Amazon (MKE1) which is located in kenosha for two years, I started working there when they first launched in 2015. When i first started my employment there the atmosphere was fun. I met a lot of cool and amazing people. Over the years it begin to go down hill because the original management team were transferred to new roles at various fulfillment, which resulted new managers. Some of these managers had little or no experience. I felt there was a lot of favoritism and cliques involved, as well as butt kissing too. Amazon is a great company don't get me wrong, but when it comes to career advancement employees must kiss there managers butt to get a head and the pay isn't all that great either for the work that is performed. you clock in and go too stand up do your stretches after that they tell you your job duties for the day and the velum for that working day after you go too the doors and loud up the trailers I enjoyed working there, I just didn’t like how slowly I moved up. The pay was great but the people weren’t. All in all it was a great opportunity. I encourage anyone to apply The typical day at work was me showing up for 10 hours to do a repetitive task. While the work wasn't difficult I did have some issues with the secular they gave me. They set one of my mandatory overtime days to Sundays, as fair as I am aware I informed them I wasn't available that day. They also refused to change it after informing them that I go to church on Sundays, in addition to getting a letter written by my pastor verifying that I do so. Their reason was 'I wasn't a part of the service.' when I inquired the HR why my request was rejected. Also you will want to bring your check book with you to orientation. I didn't and it took me a mouth for me to access my first paycheck via an ADP pre-paid Visa Card, they are the only company that I have ever worked for that do not mail out live checks I would hope they change that. Another negative aspect of working at amazon from October - January you will be working 50 hour weeks, unless you use PTO, UTO, or Sick time to get out of it. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. I worked for Amazon as a summer job. it was a great experience and I learned a lot about great teamwork and making good goals to reach my full potential. They were very conscious about safety and made sure we all knew how to do our jobs the best that we could. however getting a job feels very impersonal and if you call hr you get a call center that has written scripts to help you. so could have been better at that aspect. I would work there again if possible.  I enjoyed the ISS/problem solving aspect of the job.  It was a shame that they closed the Coffeyville, KS fulfillment center. I liked working for Amazon because my coworkers were very nice,friendly and fun to work with.The supervisors are very helpful and professional.It was fast paced and the day went by quick. ..as it was a new facility, and supposedly we had set company records during the holiday season, it just wasn't enough, it was only about setting more records.. The job talk like they care but they don’t. You will have to to overtime just to make your rent when you ask for a shift change they say they can do it but when you put in for a shift change they say that they can’t do it only if you are in school or medical readon Expected to pack 75 items per hour and restroom trips will negatively affect production.  Equipment failure counts against your production.  Employees experience physical injuries due to repetitive physical work. friendly place to work. a lot of walking. the most enjoyable part of the job is the start up meeting ..leader ship train employee very well..you can feel safe working for amazon Was put in a position I had never done before at any job ever in my life. They put me in a order picker position. The training was rushed and not organized very well at all. Hr was no help, asked to be put in different dept that did not require driving a order picker/forklift and was told that was not an option unless I went to a doctor and they filled out paperwork saying what medical reason was I could not work as order picker,. Totally ridiculous!! Had motion sickness everyday, went to Amcare 3x and they said that they didn't know what could be wrong, lol, I knew but they played dumb I guess. Spent more time in the bathroom being sick then doing the job. Only option I was given was resign if could not do job. If you have forklift experience then yeah it's an okay job but you won't get paid enough for what they expect you to pick on your shift. Plus the lunch break is only 30 mins. Not enough time to eat and relax for work your put through. Only good thing is the benefits but your not making enough money for your expected to do. Amazon was a good paying job it just didn’t work with my schedule . I scabbed boxes & placed them where they belonged . Most of the time the boxes were heavy . They can handle their stuff a little better pay a little bit more for their people or their benefits and be a little less on stressful. They could give their people all a locker as well This job is the worst place to work. If you make a error in amazon terms you will get written up no matter if u just started or it’s your first week. The management act like they care but they really don’t. The only ones who truly care about your work ethic is the ambassadors. The management there is dizzy. This is the worst company an will not be referring no one to this job. They have their favorites and they watch who they want to watch and not the ones the should be watching. Plus you don't get the proper help or guidance that you need... Some of the management have  no people skills and are clueless but overall it is a great place to work and they have excellent benefits available from the 1st day of work. There is nothing hard about any job in the warehouse but it is very fast paced and goal oriented. Too much preferential treatment in this workplace, the Supervisors only see what they want to see, very disrespectful to people they don't  like.Most associates can never do enough or work fast enough to earn their respect. This was a great place to work I enjoyed it it was A competitive first place job it also gave great wage and wonderful hours I learned a lot I learned how to deal with different people and I have to say that I feel this job preparing me better for the all around workplace experience I personally would recommend this job to anybody looking for a job to build a foundation for the rest of their life It can be highly stressful trying to meet the ever increasing quotas that seem to be set arbitrarily by management. Not a very good work/life ratio. However, they offer benefits starting the first day. If that's what you're looking for, then this is a decent place to work. They offer VTO and PTO benefits as well. There are some good bonuses for working here that are supposed to make up for the lower than area average pay. Bad work environment slave labor. bad work hours. I did not like working for this company I will never recommend anyone to work there. painful physically. supervisors are not understanding of personal employee issues. Amazon was fun to work for and I wish I had not quit. They work with you and your scheduling needs. All the staff are great and treat you kindly. I wish I could go back. Great work experience past paced but enjoyable. One of the best customer service jobs I experienced. Customers were nice as well and easy going great over all. Amazon as a warehouse is a great place to see how it would be in any ordinary warehouse in the US. Its a great place to learn and possibly grow in an already booming online retail market (for some) An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Worked for amazon IND5 location in indianapolis In for almost a year. Great benefits but you cant lack and its hardwork so be prepared to work for the pay. While I personally was able to exceed expectations during my time at Amazon, what they demand versus what they pay is entirely unreasonable to the average person. This company is not friendly towards those with disabilities, and leaves no room for those who simply want to come to work and get through a normal day. With a packing rate expectation of 60 packages an hour, only those who are physically advanced can achieve or exceed that hourly rate. For what they demand, they should be paying their employees at least $15.00/h. Working there for almost a year I learned to dread any news of sales, or anything related to Prime Day or the holiday season. During these times the warehouse would be pushed past its production capacity and would grind to a halt as the assembly lines shut down for minutes at a time because the shipping dock cannot possibly process the full amount of incoming packages being produced by the Packing and Picking groups. Meanwhile the expectation of 60 packages an hour persists and packers will often be seen surrounded by a wall of packages or resort to filling transport cages with those packages in order to try and achieve the hourly rate expectation. Every second must be used as efficiently as possible at all times in order to meet Amazon's expectations. The environment at Amazon was fast paced and there always opportunities for advancement. The management team was always willing to discuss any issues you may have had and HR was always friendly Lots of opportunity, and many people move frequently from one position to the next.  Ideal for the person who embraces constant change and flux with working contacts.  With the rapid growth and addition of business segments, many positions are rotated in 2 years or less. I learned how to do problem-solving witch is basically where I overshadow an employee of mine and they would come to me if they have a lost damaged or stolen item I would basically implement that into the system. Micromanagement galore!  They track you on everything, even bathroom breaks.  If you didn't meet their sometimes unrealistic goals, you were written up.   Sometimes you were written up for no good reason.  Unreliable work volume. Never get too comfortable. Always try to improve and makes sure never to leave your badge at home. Arrive on-time and get bonuses. The overall experience is good though. The people will make you comfortable. Just don't be lazy or carefree. I worked at Amazon.com as a seasonal employee who had the opportunity to stay for longer. The job is fast paced, you need to be self motivated (meaning no boss is looking over your shoulder the way they would in an office), customers can be rude at times, and very busy, but they trained me well and I did advance during my time, twice. Each time I advanced I was trained. I worked from home but tools were provided for me. My managers were there for me when I needed them and our group was helpful to one another. It does take some adjustment when you first get hired if you have not been in the field before. Work was ok, but they train you and you learn so much but the test to confirm what you learn rarely happens and it feels like a waste. Also it was far was an energetic place to work and very demanding.the managment was young so wasnt quite okay they were more worried about other things than managing their crew. make you clock out at breaks management doesn't care always working overtime can never take vacationvery slow and boring work environment................ Pretty straight forward. Pay is great work isn't too hard , management sucks it's a good place to work I still currently work there just on here looking for a side job I loved working there! The hours were long and it's a lot of hard work, but pay is amazing. You do work 10 or so hours 4 days a week and during peak you could work anywhere from 5- 6 days a week, so for me there wasn't enough time for friends and family because you would just want to sleep or catch up on other responsibilities. Not the worst job, as the hours aren't the worse, but management was all over the place and couldn't connect on the same things. Worse part of the job was the nature of trying to get more hours, but eh trust given to it's workers is a huge plus. They have nice management there, and a lot of benefits. But their is a lot of physical activity. Where split into tams and would often compete for prizes which was nice. But its impossible to meet your quota unless your a trained Athlete My body hurts every night when I get off of work. Amazon is challenging but in a good way. It keeps you on your toes as things will change in a heartbeat. Start each day as if it is Day1,be focused, know your goals and find innovative ways to execute the goals. I really liked my job at Amazon. i wish that there was room to grow with the the position i was in. I worked faithfully for 4 years. But i realized that it was time to move to a company the i could grow and make more money. My role is basically personal shopping in a grocery store.  It keeps me active and i can interact with the Team members in the store several times a week and make friends.  We have metrics, but if you stay on task it is easy once you learn the ropes. My stay with Amazon was for a small period, as such the above rating about this company is based on working with the supervisory staff at that time which I definitely know is in contrast with the reputation, this leading company enjoys.If given a position appropriate to my ability and experience, I would love to work in this one of the leading companies of the world. I found this position to be physically demanding I'm very demanding all my time but they also financially compensated very well including better than most similar positions at other places in town. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Moviated succeed to meet your quota. The shift is very long and you are constantly in pain but you have to stretch to get relief.The work culture is vey good . You are constantly pressured and told to work work faster than the machines or be fired for getting below/ behind on production.Break room is awesome, environment is awesome, training is fun to attend, hiring process is the worst i've seen according to the length of time it takes to become employed, however I wish that the managers among others were more understanding that life does happen I wasn't sure about working for Amazon.  Hours and pay was questionable.  This definitely surprised me! You have the ability to do so much here.  Wouldn't be surprised if this didn't become my permanent career. I wouldn’t recommend this job for long-term work. Even less so if you’re looking to advance in the company. It feels more like a side job than something to pay the bills. Keep all my workers on task .  Paper work in the office as well  handling organization or work being passed Recomending out new ways to do work  better an faster AWS is a great technology company.  The consulting arm is in disarray.  The management has set a path that does not support their 'mission' nor does it make the consultants very happy.  Top level executives peer into low lever managers businesses and say they let you run your own business but then question everything you do.  The technical parts of the the organization are much better.  But again beware many seasoned managers with career obsession - stomping on everyone and anyone to advance their job level to get more stock.  Look for positions in technology and not consulting. Solid career option. I like working for the company overall, it has its pros and cons as every company does. I’m just looking to progress to management now and not wait. Highly demanding work environment. Work life balance is the least of the companies priorities. Company promotes a 3-4 day work week but company will make it a 5-6 day work week along with expecting more. Peak season are 60-70 hr work weeks. Being a Warehouse Associate at Amazon is a fatiguing and laborious job.  Near mechanical in nature, it is not mind stimulating,but that is what one expects of such a job, right?  Very good benefits with low pay.  The benefits for most employees are the hook. great place to work,great peoples ,follows all safety rules great benefices ,i would like to stay there to build a career but at that time it's was only a prime part-time position. Gotta be quick on your feet, Smart, and try not to overthink things due to wasting to much time which they do not want.Gotta be delivering alot of packages that just keep on adding later on.Alot of there Vehicles are dangerous due to lack of maintenance.Have you busting your butt of for little Pay.They make you drive recklessly just cause they want to finish there delivery packages on time even tho they add more and more packages and still expect it to be done. If you are a direct hire to Amazon the benefits are endless. The worst parts of the job were that there was no air conditioning in a large hot warehouse, lots of walking, limited breaks, short lunch, and mandatory overtime. The best part of the job are the paid time off, overtime pay, and medical, dental, and vision benefits. I loved working here, I wish I had been able to say, but they do not have accommodations for disable people even though they claim to have. Fun place to work but some mangers will make you want to pull your hair out. Other than that I would recommend working here to anyone especially during holiday season because you can easily get 60 hours per week plus time and a half. I enjoyed my time working there. My boss was fair and encouraging and helpful.  I worked at Amazon as a contracted employee so I did not receive benefits. Last shift usually ended early not always a good thing if counting on hours long lines to get through for breaks due to security they did not have a dress code better to make sure tags were current as I seen a lit of cars getting toed The atmosphere was conducive to a well balanced production line. I would have like to work for AMAZON full-time and not for a temp service. Amazon is a company that a person can grow. Very stressing environment, very poor coordination and long working hours and the pay is under the living wage. Job is not very secured, one could be fired anytime for no reason. I love workin here everyone is friendly and supervisorAre all about they workers future any question they will help you with anything you need and if you get hurt they on you quick Management at MKC6 is the worst, lack of training in most departments unless you demand more, quick to give write-ups to associates who dont hit rate, but are hardly there to give coachings on bettering the associate. I've heard other buildings are better with these types of things, MKC6 is just not where it should be with caring for the employees. They do have amazing benefits and incredible pay, lots of prizes you can win just for going into work. The job overall i would say is fine if you like being in one place all day and getting your job done. Money was great here and they have wonderful benefits. My experience here with the Mangement was not so good. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Great place to work and fun at lunch time, during the your phone suppose to be in your locker s there will be no distraction on the floor. No phones on the gets the work done and makes its more smooth through out the day. at lunch to are able to play the game (PS4), play pool or ping pong and eat what you can afford. Amazon Fulfilment Center is a great job to work for, if you are use to warehouse jobs. I work at the CMH1 location and I have no problem working at this location it’s worth the pay that you get paid. Great management and PA’s make it worth working. Great place to work if you are desperate. Not enough pay for the work and time you are REQUIRED to put in. It is slave-work for the avg. person. You'd better be in great shape, this job will drain your mind, body, and soul. it is very lonely in a warehouse full of people you aren't allowed to talk or have music. I think that amazon Dosent pay their employee much is not fare they should pay more it’s hard to live off of 11 dollars and hour especially if you ha e kid Amazon has too many areas of opportunity to rate them all.  I was involved in a few and the one take-away was and remains:  While exceptional external customer service was always the aim, internal customer service is shabby and impersonal. Management needs improvement!!!! Coworkers were amazing. I really enjoyed working there until new management came in and made working there unbearable. Amazon is a fantastic place to work if you want to hone your problem solving skills and leadership. There is opportunity for advancement, and many other great benefits. amazon does not care about their worker, if they could they would replace everyone with machines. it is a work camp where you cant use the restroom for no longer then 15 mins. without being asked where you were. they track all your movements. you get two 15 min paid breaks but it really like two 7 min breaks depending where you are in the building. they pretend that moving up is easy but never give the opportunities to train in areas to progress. they is no way to get fresh food on lunches, they expect you to show up 15 mins early but wont pay you for it. they rates are over the top and not one manager in the building will give a straight answer for any question asked Amazon is by nature a fast paced environment. It's not for everyone. You have an hourly 'stow' rate to adhere to. However, other factors can effect your rate. Such as the pace at which the packages come your way They can come slower than usual (because the people unloading are going at a slow rate) or it can come rapidly (the manager might decide to flood the belts with packages in order to get the truck unloaded and move onto the next). Management is fully aware of this. They have to meet their goals, and if it's at the associates expense...so be it.Another factor is other associates coming by to to work in your assigned area because their area doesn't have any. All the while this is happening, you have management 'encouraging'   you to get a move on. The hourly rate is enticing, but the culture is abominable! Associates undermining each other, in some cases; dictating what to do, without the authority to do so.Ambassadors (or manger want to be's) are in most cases incompetent and shouldn't be ambassadors. Working fast hot in there.You are making pods there is really good money you can make. Alot of over time for the people that need it. You get a 15 min break then a hour for lunch. Amazon is an excellent place to work if you are just now entering the work force or are in need of honest employment. I am more interested in a position that has more options in terms of growth and compensation. Picker/Stowing Picking items at fast and efficient pace without making errors. Rewards for picking at a fast, efficient pace without making errors. Time at work goes by fast. Perfect place if you're looking to make some extra cash but as far as making a career of it , I wouldn't recommend it .. It's fine to have as an second source of income . far from enough to be considered to be your main source .. The job can be tedious and boring at times and your isolated for 10 hrs a day , well thats what it feels like .. It depends on who you are because it can be a toxic working environment .. I was there 5 years and I can't say it was all bad but it wasn't all good either .. My story doesn't stop here but why get into all that .. I'm moving forward .. Amazon gets a grade of C- fun place to work people were  friendly.managers easy going very clean building supplied with utencils vending machines if you forget your lunch tv,video games and ping pong tables for your enjoyment on breaks Not a good place to work. They don't promote from inside, very poor choice of management. Pay not compatible with the workload. If you have an issue HR is not a good place to go. Great company, work culture could use work must invest great amounts of time to advance but advancement very possible for management type persons who start at entry level. Team work is key in this division, and working with truly committed and talented people makes this a great growing experience.  It's challenging and hard driving.  But also rewarding. The company like to hire a lot of new employees in order for them to give them laid off later on. The discount is 10%. They cut hours and get mad at us when we asked them why. fast paced. long work days. you work hard there is opportunities for extra training. needs better management, co-workers are fun to work with. the hardest part is making the out outrageously high hourly rate. you do not make it then they wan't to write you up. breaks are actually shorter then they tell you they are. they count the time it takes you to get from your work area to the break room in with your break times. Extremely competitive with high performance expectations. Always on 24/7 with the goal posts always moving. Scaling globally through self-service or automation critical. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Fired me because I got into a car accident and missed work. Then when I came in with a doctor's note to cover one of the days HR said they didn't accept Doctor's notes. That's life at Amazon. Always trying to take, and take, and take more from someone and then drop them like it's nothing. There loyal to there customers fast problem solving skills and make sure all customers order are shipped out correctly and on time. They are also Good to there employer because like they say with Happy employers means good work. I'm very grateful for all I learned and all the opportunities I had at Amazon, but I still find it the strangest mixed bag of a place I've ever worked for.  In some respects it's highly efficient, state-of-the-art, convenient, customer-friendly, etc.; in others, it's sheer farce and chaos (beneath a thin veneer).  For example, job advancement can be weirdly difficult, and this has been not just my experience but also that of many people I worked with.  Overall, Amazon tries to be decent (for instance, with benefits and flexibility) while remaining thrifty (as with compensation and work load). I liked working there. Except that due to having to take a college exam, they were not flexible with my schedule and so I quit. I use to work for Logistics scanning packages. Apply if you like working in a fast paced environment. Keep your numbers well above goal, so you can let them slip when you need to take a potty break. Expect to be worked to the bone but you are well compensated for your time as a manager.  The company does follow its values and beliefs and truly does revolve around the customer which is refreshing to see. Decent hours, respectful supervisors. It is 12 hour days, but with the fast-paced environment it did not feel like 12 hour days. I worked independently 99% of the time! Exhausting, grunt work, with no empathy or compassion. In thousands of dollars of debt, due to an injury and poor health coverage. Can't even afford to receive the care I need so I'm not in pain.  Every minute they cant track your productivity is questioned and scrutinized. I enjoyed working around a lot of people in a warehouse. fast paced but it was also very safe. the training helped me in my overall work there. my supervisors were very polite friendly and responded to any of my questions accurately. it was also a very clean work environment. Amazon is very strict and if you look at somebody wrong consider yourself fired. you are a robot there. i had a horrible day every day i worked there. walking around always afraid i would do something wrong. oh, and just think there are 800 people behind you waiting to get your job. Working at Amazon was a great experience but however there are some  unprofessional workers and a lot of unorganized things in their work force. I really did enjoy working there It's okay the people are friendly. the work is stressful they always want you to work work  work sometimes people get really tired because all they want you to do is rush and make sure you get the work done. just a warehouse job, but you must be willing to work hard and not be offended by being treated like a number. management is often young and inexperienced. policies often enforced inconsistently. Amazon has a very laid back environment and a very learn as you go way of working environment. The Management is very cool and laid back. Just do your assigned job and everything should go well for you. It was repetitive tasks daily. Scan, stack, and wrap pallets. I enjoyed the stretching sessions as a team before work. It was a really nice and secure environment. good work place, Fun and good peoplevery difficult to work in the summer because of the heat but they refreashments  try there best to accommodate your needs with Amazon has a huge turnover.  Managers are not the most friendliest or helpful at all.  You are not allowed to have a water bottle near you and god forbid you are late because of an accident on the highway.  They will fire you for being late. They expect so much from you and kill you physically little by little and the pay is horrible for a company that makes so much money, also they will fire you over any little thing. I got layed off but they wanted to fire my mom for not packing 100 packages an hour. It’s okay the money is good to many young workers a lot of drama no job security my grandfather died and a mange threw my obituary away that I was told to bring in as prof I’ve worked for them over a year Great company to work for. I would recommend anyone to work for amazon because of how good of a company it is and how fast it is still growing and will grow. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Long shifts with lots of walking. Periodic discussions with other employees and management about ensuring productivity and successful workflow. Very impersonal environment. They have paid time off. A very fast paced work environment.  A very up beat and competitive work zone. They also have a very relaxed dress code that makes it easier to work. It was good, fast paced, easy work for the money.  Then I got promoted to PA, they didn't want to give me a raise.  The handbook says you get a dollar raise when you become a teir 3, all I got was 25 cents only after I fought for it.  Managers can be great or they can be self absorbed and lazy.  HR is lacking in the compassion department.  They need to be retrained in diversity.  If you ask for their help they turn around and accuse you of things and set you up to be fired.  Most of the employees have a negative attitude, so if you want to survive, try to find the ones who have still have a great and positive attitude.  Management is dropping like flies because they are finding jobs elsewhere that pay more.  PA's and Management don't get cost of living increases so level one associate eventually make more than the managment.  Therefore there is no real incentive to want to advance to an assistant or manager position when you can stay and entry level associate and make more money than them.  Stock option is a joke.  You get one stock a year.  That's it.  Eventually it will be none. i enjoyed working for this company i wish they had more full time positions. If they did i would come back to Amazon. The best thing about this company is you got paid every week. working at amazon is great experience but its kind of hard to find child care with the hours that they provide for the workers. the jobs gives you chances to get more hours but if you don't have proper child care it kind of seems pointless not a good environment, poor management, poor employee care, poor balance of life and work, poor opportunities to advance, poor pay wage, poor compensation Probably very common at Amazon. You got great coworkers, but that's pretty much all about it. No benefits whatsoever. Incompetent managers. No work-life balance. Politics. Good place to work for a few hours each day. Management is enjoyable. You get 20 hrs a week but can get more hours through the week if offered. A good place to work. Very productive and technology advanced place filled with amazing hard working people. Although it is a great job with many benefits and positions to gain higher pay, just like any other warehouse job, it is not for everyone. Do you need a job right now? They will hire you. Will you stay at this job? Most likely not. From my experience 30% quit within the first 2 days. Then in a week another 30%. In two weeks maybe another 20 to 30% will leave. The rest will leave in time. This was my experience at least. I had a great manager until he moved up and he was replaced with someone inadequate and I left due to stress they gave me. I did not understand that I had to resign to apply for a management position.  After inquiring about management positions, the people working as HR representatives, were not very helpful, once they ascertained that I had a degree.  I asked an Area Manager about a career path to management and he gave me pertinent information.  However, I got hurt on the Job and did not have enough time off to recuperate per off time hours. Long and lots of standing, counting walking and not enough time for lunch. Typical work day didn't like working weekends. The work you do should be paid more. Hardest part of the job lifting heavy buckets.Supervisors have favorites. The difficulty of the intern projects varies much from team to team. I've worked in a database team called the Redshift where C/C++ code are extensively used. For someone who likes low-level system programming and optimization this will be great place. Great work environment, set schedules, paid time off/holidays , good management, always something to do, two fifteen minute breaks, some days catered lunch. 10 hour days and overtime on holidays. 10 hour days we good tho, cuz you only had to work 4 days a week. is a job thats good if you like being physical. Your experience here is very team dependent, that said there's a lot of very bad managers. Little autonomy, you get thrown from project at the whims of upper management. Great experiences were provided throughout my time. There are all stars and low performers but if you look for growth you will find people to assist you in your goals! Working at amazon is okay,however. I don't feel like they really care about their employees health. They over work their employees and expect them to be fine. I learned to multi-talk, I also got to meet many of people. The hardest part of the job was when things are behind, it makes your job a lot harder which can mentally drain someone but I learned to come up with my own route so I won't become mentally drained,stressed,BODY PAIN,etc. It was such a great experience and i would recommend someone to try it! Great opportunity for your first job out of college. you will be molded by leadership principles that will transfer to outside amazon if you so choose. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Overall, I have no complaints. Once I advanced my way to 'Lead Coach' I was more then appreciative! I was 7 months pregnant when I left Amazon, which is why I left. A newborn and those hours didn't work for me at the time. I enjoyed my experience there and would recommend the rapidly growing company to anyone. I absolutely loved working here and was sad when I had to leave. The work is very fast-paced and physically demanding but it helps the time go by fast. It was actually a really fun experience for me. I loved working at amazon and with all the other staff. The workers made me feel comfortable and always had a positive attitude to another. Amazon is a good place to work, the pay should be more , it's like once you hit that certain amount of years that's your pay not unless they give you a cost of living raise or something. Fun place to work with flexible hours, there was a lot of interaction with management and they were easy to talk to about anything from how to do tasks to just casual conversations on break. Not the best for night or twilight shift. Transporting boxes with a team that didn't always wanna work  but chat yet always full of drama. No more night shift. workplace culture couldve been better, management was a revolving door with no connection to the work force, the benefits were ok, Amazon doesnt appreciate its employees Job was stressful and not enough movement for me. im more of a hands on tpye of person i rather work with cars or walking around with other people learning new things I walk in and clock in as usual then we have a meeting about how much mail we have then we get right to work. I learned that you have to have a positive attitude everyday and work efficiently as well. Management was great they took care of any problem i had.MY work place was great everyone was nice young and old. The hardest part of my job is not having more work for me to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is just being there i enjoy every second of it. Craziness terrible managingno guaranteesunorganizedunprofessionaldog eat dogunfairsneakyhard worknot enough paynot compensated for helping with work On seasonal days is mandatory to work an extra 20 hours on top of the 40 hours already worked.  There is a high turn over rate because of this stressful job.  Especially if working overnight. Good service a lot of benefits and career choices and paid vacation good place for opportunities multiple task and reasonable managers and great insurance Good working place, very comfortable, teachable, skills of hardworking ethics, very relaxed work place. Treat employees very appropriate.............. it was a great place to work at i really enjoyed working their and working with the managers in place. Its a good place to move up if you work hard and I would go back Most days are filled with phone calls with sellers or other duties as assigned. Teams are made and dissolved at random and associates can be fired for small offenses. Overtime can be made mandatory with little to no notice. Most of the Managment team do a good job, but there are a few bad apples in the bunch. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with constantly changing demands, and not having any opportunities to advance unless you become a mentor. With overtime demands and few opportunities for time off, there is little work/life balance. People in other roles at Amazon (Software Devs, Engineers) do not take Seller Support Associates seriously. The best part of the job is the insurance benefits. The benefits are good, but you'll need a thick skin to deal with the bad choices made by the higher ups in your work environment. It would be nice if leadership did less watching and pointing and more working on the floor. Fast-paced, nothings ever good enough, leads don't care just want more and more results from you. short breaks! Hr pathetic!.....Good benefits though..... Overall Management can be a bit cumbersome. But as they say, this is only a stepping stone. The expected productivity might be difficult to make and keeping and eye on your Unpaid Time Off is a must. I was always busy always had something to do and there was always more work to get done my co-workers were normally always friendly and laid back there was no pressure unforced upon worked but all worker's knew what was expected of them by the end of every shift of every day Training was thorough.  Both my trainer and supervisor were down to earth. Strict policies but great support at your fingertips.  Pay and benefits are fair.  Opportunities for advancement based on performance metrics. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. This was the worst place that I ever worked at.I have one word . SLAVERYI never thought in today's society a companytreats people as poorly as Amazon.The CEO is the richest man but the people that help him are on food stamp with no heath insurance! At Amazon, you have to keep up with picking. If you fell behind at picking, you have to be retrained and you will be given a write up. If you are given more than three write ups, your job at Amazon will be terminated. Was really fun in the beginner of the shift the manager explain the plan for the day also we always do exercise. After that we need to check the board to see in what duty we will be during the day ,however sometimes they change us everything depend where they need us to make the goal of the  value they have. My experience was fantastic.  II learned something every day from the smartest and most diverse group I have ever worked with.  Every day was different and challenging.  I had great mentors throughout my time there. It's a great place to work part-time. There's always something to do inside the warehouse. It's never a dull place to work. It's also a great place to meet people. Initiative and independent thinking is always encouraged. There can be really busy days, especially during the holidays. It's fun to work here. I love this job and the hours are always there and always a chance to do overtime. Managers are great leaders and the warehouse main priority is the safety of its people. It is a nice place to work but the salary I get paid and the job are not balanced.  I love what I do but it is better if the company balanced the capacity of the work that employees do and the salary they paid are equal. Terrible place to work, High school level gossip, favoritism, Managers and HR fired associates with little to no reason or evidence, high turn over rate, Managers constantly violated safety rules and regulations, little opportunity for advancement. I've been with Amazon for about 11 months.  It's not a stressful job, but it's just that a job.  This wouldn't be a place to look for a career unless you are a programmer or great at something that's internet based.  For people like me going to school for something that Amazon isn't involved in it's just a job. Scan boxes/packages for most of the shift. Management is decent. Best thing to do is to mind your own business because there will be a lot of lazy workers. You'll feel like you're working twice as hard. Pay raise hardly comes by. Good place to work and lots of overtime. Good pay. Sometimes it's downtime but a lot of times you Stay busy. Wear comfy clothes and shoes as u will be on Thor feet a lot. Would not recommend this job to anyone!Extremely stressful; high turn over rate!Never enough work, management always streesed so their attitudes are awful! Fast paced environment that monitors your every move.Recommend for those without kids or other important obligations.Be prepared to walk and stand the entirety of your shift.Expect to be somewhat dirty from handling packages.Great opportunity to meet others and build working relationships.Volunteer for everything, every time; it will get you noticed by management and may lead to a promotion of sorts.Have a positive attitude and do not think your job or role is any less important, you're part of a big team and every shift there are goals that need to be met. You can move up in Amazon, if you are willing to relocate. When you do move up to L4 and above, that is when a person can start making good money. But you have to move, in order to move up. i took a buy out and was told i could never work for amazon againhours were bad no advancementneed closer break rooms and chance to sit longer and rest the compensation was decent being that i don't have much responsibility. my manager would let me know if something was wrong with my rate or quality.. I liked the job it was just the pay was a bit confusing an off at first an I needed to locate to a more efficient job...It was definitely a test of diligence and strength but with time an more hours it will reflect on further checks just not the first two checks maybe 3...I will say stay to yourself in that place don't try and make friends stay focused on your work an listen to your coordinator at all times... The job is consistent and not that taxing as long as you are willing to follow orders. Some of the managers were nice, but others clearly see you as another cog in the machine. Required to come in early in ,most departments to place employees in their prospective jobs for the day.Collect the previous day\shift production numbers and help determine needs in the production number lowPrepare for stand up meeting that occurs before work and at lunch.Communicate with upper management any needs or changes that may occur ex.associates leaving early A workday at amazon would last about 10 hours with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. I was trained in the customer returns department, processing and decanting, The workplace is very large and has a lot going on simultaneously. The hardest part about the job is that you're on your feet the whole shift and the short lunches. The most employable part of the job would be the benefits which include the discounts and stock options. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Pays some of the bills. It is hard work. You will be on your feet for the full 10 hours a day. Most people there are nice. It has decent health benefits when it is not an emergency situation. I enjoyed being a Waterspider and supplying my co workers with the supplies that they neefed daily.The fact that my hard work was appreciated and respected allowed me to learn different disciplines and tasks. Working at amazon taught me how to manage all types of people in a fast past high production rate work area.  It is not a job for everyone because it requires serious physical labor and you must meet certain rates etc to maintain your job no excuses.  This was not a problem for me because I am used to working long hard hours and have the desire to always learn more and move up, but that is what amazon lacked for me.  I had reached my maximum pay for my position and could not get promoted without going back to school for a degree which was not possible with the hours I was required to work and the physical tole it took on me. the pay difference, if any, for someone driving an order picker and someone who stands in one spot or loads trucks doesn't seem fair.  Its alot more risk, brain power, and stress to operate an order picker. Base of what we have send in socialmedia about the owner. We don’t see it with the management here. However the benefit will keep you going and the chance for advancement. Here at Hou2 its a cycle with management and your voice never get heard. Not a lot of minorities advancement here or management. The job itself wasn't too bad. Depending on what job and department you were in. Management is mostly people fresh out of college that have no real people or life skills and don't know how to handle a lot of employee concerns. Working 10 hour shifts can be hard especially when working overtime. I hurt my knee but could not afford to pay for rehab and was told I could be crosstrained for a role with less walking and stair climbing but once I went out on medical leave waiting for the doctor to fill out my paperwork I had a hard time getting the HR department on the phone. I called five times in a week and never heard back until they let me go saying i had been on leave for to long. I tried getting in touch with someone but never heard back. Warehouse work. Get there early and leave late. Warehouse doesnt have AC so in the summer you cook inside of there. Real time rates for functions like picking and packing that roll into your break. Worst job ever. I love a different job everyday. Quiet and enjoyable blocks yet sometimes it can get aggravating. Love the group on FB as it gives you feedback on questions you may have. Starting off, you're given a lot of things and you can advance yourself professionally in pretty much any aspect you desire. Work is always fun on they daily, but can be stressful when its crunch time and everyone wants to finish for the day. Good place to work at with good hours and great pay. Friendly co-workers and nice managers. Make sure to stick to your tasks to get your work done in time. I enjoyed working with the Team at Amazon they kept it really fun and live as any job you have some friendly managers and some not so friendly but i liked getting paid weekly and would still be there if it wasn't for my health. They are not willing to accommodate people with disabilities.  They put you on short term disability so that they can accommodate the person; however, once they receive all medical documentation they are not willing to accommodate the disability. Lots of angry people on the phone. Not a lot of wiggle room to help them, which is a huge downgrade from when I first started, which at that time you had a huge ability to help customers, but then they started reducing your ability to make exceptions. Lots of being yelled at. People were cool to work with, but the culture of the actual company is a garbage fire of over competitive networking. I would only recommend this job for young people or college students. I mean maybe for people that are just looking for extra in come. choosing this type of job from the bottom as a career not a good idea. Straight out of college working for corporate yeah! Smart people but moral crushing culture. Backstabbing and politics is rampant. Managers are forced to stack rank. There is a facade of company caring about their employees but the managers will throw you under the bus if need be. I am here only for salary and brand name - Stay away if you can: I have seen atleast 5 people who were exceptional at their work but were shoved out based  on 'performance issues' when in reality they were just layoffs (company has to force people out since it is bad PR if they layoff). Amazon is fine. When I started several years ago I believed they were the best company around. The problem is that they’ve grown so big, so fast. Other companies have taken what only Amazon was doing 5-10 years ago and exceeded it. Amazon’s massive and rapid growth has prevented them from adapting to current employee expectations. The majority of management consists of college recruits with no experience. Meanwhile I started at the bottom while going to school. Thought once I had my degree it would open me up to promotional opportunities. My manager told me that I had a better chance getting hired into those positions straight out of college with no previous Amazon experience. Amazon doesn’t value their employees the way they should. If they did, the folks that have been there and dedicated to the company for years would be able to get promotions beyond just a tier 3. It’s a real shame because tier 1 and tier 3 positions cap out on pay after 3 years so myself and many of my coworkers haven’t had a pay raise in over 3 years. My opinion is that as an employee of Amazon, I am not paid enough for the work that I do. I am in the top 10 of the warehouse which has 5000 workers and my pay does not show that one bit. I also would like to move up in the company, not going to happen. Amazon works you very hard. It wouldn't have been such a bad job if the breaks where longer and the pay was better. wouldn't tell anyone to apply there. It's part-time, labor intensive, enjoy co-workers, have a happy attitude. Accept any and all additional training. Be friendly and cooperative with all fellow co-workers. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Not flexible with working schedule. It did not work well with my families busy life. Working from home is not something I care to do. Managers weren’t readily available. Working at Amazon has been the best decision I’ve ever made. The safety and work culture is fantastic. If you don’t get pumped up on the floor just by the safety culture to everyone has, this probably isn’t the job for you. Productivity changes daily. Manager often can’t make decisions on their own for as placement of employees. My place as a floater I never what I’m doing throw out the day. nice work environment, clean break room with lots of food choices and ice machines and tv. Managers are easy to talk to and everyone is easy to work with. Very easy if you put your mind to it.Show up on time, try to do your best with your paste.Sometimes it minght get a little hard but the goal is to work hard and have fun Needing to keep pace and rate. Rate isn't achievable especially when you aren't getting anything to scan. And if you do, good luck making reasonable rate. All attention needs to me focused on finding the smallest packages and totes to meet rate even though they say we aren't allowed to do that. All this is also in part with 'Hardest part of the job'.The requirements set you up for failure. Hard rates to meet, hard to advance, management picks favorites, bad communication, mandatory 60hour weeks from mid November til the end of December. But those paychecks are nice, you get stock every year, chances for monthly bonuses, benefits are good, they pay for some schooling! You get chances to move and travel helping open up new sites around the world. Companies work to take care of their shareholders, their customers, and their employees, but they can only pick two. Amazon is very good to its customers and shareholders. It was the co-workers that kept me going. It is a collaborative and fun atmosphere when you work along side hard working people that are there to work but are nice. There was minimal drama queens and kings in my section. took me a little time to adjust to standing for 10 hours a night but once i did everything went great time flew bye and lots of over time they really care about there employees Forced to work harder and get more done as time goes by. Been there over a year and work load is almost doubled with the same pay rate, same hours and the same amount of workers or even less since I started working here. no work life balance .ate this company*requiredOverall rating*Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob Culture The work can get difficult when there is a big shipment of orders coming in, but the tasks to preform is easy, it just gets to a point where you work really fast. Amazon is the worst, they make you work long hours sometime filling multiple positions since people leave constantly.  Went in to work everyday wondering what kind of wreck I would be walking into. The only thing i can say bad about Amazon is that with out a degree there is no way to get into management.I have been there for a while and a lot of people come and go.The work place culture was fast and fun.The best part of the job was training new people and seeing them  progress in there positions.My boss made sure if you did something good he made sure you knew it as soon as possible.I started at 6 pm and worked until 5 to 6 am Sunday thru Wednesday and some times Thursday.If they gave more management positions with work experience instead of a degree i bet that a lot of people would stay.They would have days when they provided breakfast or dinner.I got a 2500.00 bonus when i was there for three months. Really is a good job but i want to be manager and at my age i dont want to be back in school. In my case they negotiated hard during my hiring time. I realized later that salary is not commensurate with the worklife balance I had. Otherwise, it is one of the best places to learn about business, strategy and customer satisfaction. Just like any other firm, some teams do have politically charged environments. A fast pace environment where customers receive their items                                                    promptly, driving stand up forklift pallet to pull customer orders, Handling packages that varied in sizes from small envelopes to boxes ranging up to 49 pounds. the most hardest part of the job was driving a stand-up forklift for the first time. The most enjoyable part was the training of the lanes from A-X filled with different products to give to the customers. Job's not bad, you'll get a lot of calls with people asking where their deliveries are, because they won't call the actual carrier to ask. People feel like you can make their packages arrive sooner. Definitely will work a lot of hours on your feet with constant feedback on what can be done better.  Financial compensation for these requirements are fair. Never a boring day always something new going on fast pace and must be able to work alone and safely while working. The work volume changes as the day go on must be able to adopt and adjust to thru out the work day. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. overworked, paid well but comes at a price.  no work life balance and management are not experienced at all.  in order to be successful there, you need to be single without a family Amazon has great benefits,pto, and unpaid time off .you also manage your time if you go negative then ur fired so as long as you watch your ok. However I've been there 5 years stuck no raises because they tell us they do evaluations in the local area on how much those companies pay their employees.Every October they seem to come back with we are paid higher if you include benefits. Not only are u stuck at 14.40 after 2 years they raise and raise your rates and change systems, rules etc to make it easier to be written up. Alot of the time they don't tell employees of these new rules or changes and then people get handed 2 write ups at the same time or even walked out. So it's very stressfull in the aspects of job security no matter how long you've worked there or how much you do there to help the daily needs. Long 10 hour days no sitting allowed no music no cell phones just warehouse loud noises. Id say it's a paycheck and i wouldnt stay longer then. ,Years you'll cap out anywas so I'd say 2 years if you can keep yourself under the radar with numbers and watch your time. i like the competitive atmosphere helps production move faster when working next to someone meet  new people & pay is good mangers definitely keep you focused on task & make sure you are meeting rates I applied for the 6:30am to 10:30 am shift and after two days we were told they were moving us to 4:30 am to 8:30am. Several of us were also told that we would be in the sorting department and were actually assigned as order picker.  If you don't care about shifts or type of work you will be doing then it might be the job for you. Not me... If you need work only.very cold sterile work place.Dont  go here.must hit the floor running at all  times.Miss a  quota get you butt fired!  i need work so went there. I quit over the  bs. You have to work hard but the pay is good. We had one paid break besides that your on your feet all day. The work was simple when you got the hang of it. Wonderful leadership that is with you every step of the way. Taking calls and making the lives of your customers a bit better for just being there to listen and help out in their distressed situation. It makes you feel like a hero at the end of each day In the Maintenance Technician world, It is hard to move up after Tech III (Level 4) because of very few 'Blue Badge' positions available.  We keep hearing that will increase, but we shall see.  I think an increase in these type of facilities and more options for techs to travel in America and abroad to take equal or greater roles in the Maintenance Tech space would vastly improve growth and outlook on maintenance, corrective and preventative, as a whole. Clock in at time clock.Go to stand up where we proceed to stretch and get ready for our day.The warehouse is very big with many departments.We  start:high volume performance,rated time picking,prepping andpacking specialist,freight line receving and processing associate.{Organized multi-task/problem solver/trouble shooter/atec is a machine that  measurements all new products comming in from vender for amazon website.They like to cross train employer so they no all departments.....A half hour for lunch ,two 15min breaks,all employees do 10 hour shifts clock out 5.30 Pm I have been at Amazon for 4 years, they have provided me opportunities that i never thought possible, i have worked in different departments under several different managers, which is a good thing and a bad thing sometimes Amazon Lab 126 is a very intense and dynamic workplace that is geared towards achieving given results in the shortest possible time.  Company is really pursuing new technologies and ideas to convert them into the new products and is willing to take a risk along the way. Good company but fast paced.... if you can’t handle being on your feet for long periods of time and keeping up with the fast paced environments this job isn’t for you. It was an ok place to work. The pay wasn't that great though. The hours you would get would not that good either if you are looking for a job to live off of. It's a job not a career if your in college or need to catch up various types of bills maybe but it is a high pressure rate based job who always ask for mandatory overtime doesn't really work with family life. Working for this company was stressful and tiring no matter what you did.to get your rate up meaning every week you have to make 100% or meet their requirements  that was the stressful part. you just have to work there to know. working at Amazon wasn't to bad, the management got to get better but over all the job with the energy is pretty good and the pay is great work four days off for 3 days Amazons people and co-workers are usually great people. It's the management that needs help in that company. Most of them are very cutthroat, and the only thing they care about is the numbers. They didn't even care that a pregnant woman was in pain bending over to do their counting, they compared it to someone complaining about a sore ankle. Management there lacks any human compassion for anything. I would come on shift, log onto the intranet, begin work orders and complete my assignments.  The job culture was to treat the maintenance dept. as bottom feeders back in 2002 I would set my station up with empty boxes, bubble wrap and dry ice for packages.Get list of product to pack from supervisor.Find product in warehouse.Put product, bubble wrap and dry ice in box.Put label on box given from supervisor.push packed box down line to pallet. Amazon is a great place to work. The environment is great. Management and HR were amazing and work with you when you're having trouble (at work or home). I really felt like they care for me. The fast paced work environment keeps you busy and in good physical shape. The people at Amazon also have a medical clinic in the facility, so any injury or illness can be dealt with accordingly. An excellent place to work. Very relaxed environment, where socializing is heavily encouraged. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help. No rush during training, able to train at a decent pace to ensure proper learning. Its a productive place to work. even as a part time employee you have some benefits but the hours could use a increase. I think the building i work at would be better if it was full-time. Amazon is a pretty lax environment. Managers are managers, co-workers are co-workers. It's an office setting, so it's pretty much what you would expect.That being said, this is a Call Center position. This position deals directly with the public and some customers will be irate, they will be irrational, and they will not care about you whatsoever. When you are on the clock, you aren't Nancy/Sue/Drew/Jerry/whoever you are, you are AMAZON. You are faceless and nameless, another voice on the phone who is supposed to fix all of the problems.There will be angry people, there will be nice people. You can't get away from that. Amazon has great benefits, they offer good things and give career opportunities. They'll send you to school, 401k, 40 hours a week, you can't get that much nowadays.Just don't go into this thinking it's an easy job, should you try to apply. It will test your patience, your mettle, your very sanity at times. If you're strong enough, go for it. You'll get some great skills out of it. It was a good stable job that paid well. As I worked there, I was able to meet some really cool people. The managers were nice and the work flow was productive. I was a contract driver for 2 years and 6 months for Amazon in Austin under the Flex umbrella. At first it was an amazing job. However once the changes started coming in, hours became more difficult to acquire, at the end of my time there it was almost impossible to get the hours. The way in which you had to get the hours was soul leeching, you couldn't live your life. When I found an app that helped me search for the hours because the shifts would go so quickly when they did appear, I was threatened with termination, yet Amazon would not give me more than 6 hours pre-scheduled a week. It is cut throat. They don't care how well you do. The first time you make a mistake you will be threatened with termination, and if they fire you they just hire someone else. Good drivers are not rewarded or taken care of, so there is really no incentive to actually do a good job. The pay per hour is decent at best ($18/hr), but the stress and amount of work you end up having to do because the warehouse screws up so much (likely due to low pay and poor working conditions) it really doesn't end up being worth it. Finally, the management (upper level) doesn't let you know when changes are coming so you end up getting screwed over multiple times. But hey that's just your problem. pays good but morale is low. You'll quickly feel drained and regularly go home exhausted. The benefits and stock options are great it can be a career if desired. stick it out for at least 2 years for the stock. Good company to work for, highly competitive and very fast paced. Amazon has extremely high standards. They try to set you up for success but poor management preventsystem this a lot of the time Loading trucks all night.Learning how to load trucks.Manangement was ok.Very busy workplace.Stacking small boxes.it was over in three months.Met a lot of good people there. when i was working here is was hard to keep up with other rates i would be stressed at some points. it was a fun job to have if you are coming straight at out high school and needing a quick job. Was a fun job but fast paced and required a lot of strenuous activity. on your feet most the day. management sits around most the day and just talks. frustrating but not as big a deal. overall a fun job. I have worked at Amazon for over a year and have been in a few different potions and found that they are all very reasonable and at times easy to do. Along with the rates they are for are very achievable. used rf scanner to scan boxes to ensure correct destination, on time everytime. codes numerical, fast paced,on move versus stanting in one place at any given time. My current job lets me work with people and build relationships.  I love pointing people in the right direction and where they need to go.  At the end of the day I feel satisfied. good people and working environment. always had a smile on there face and willing to come to work to do their job. It was good job to have if you needed a second job. Decent job, with decent people, but the traffic to get there was horrible for the hours I worked. The commute to the airport during high traffic hours caused a lot of aggravation. You have to physically prepare but the job is so worth it I’m in day 3 and as for my building i advise anybody ready to work and be part of a good company that actually cares for their workers Not just about the job that needs to be done that’s a plus The atmosphere is unbelievable and this isn’t a paid review . Friendly environment people willing to work with you to get you on the level u need to be on in the position you are in However I don’t think it’s any other job in Ohio that provide the things this job doesI FEEL LIKE THIS company is a help us we help you they stress quality control and protection procedures for you physically so u don’t get hurt i love it and the fact u can make a career out of it is another reason I don’t see why people wouldn’t jump to this opportunity you can’t lose Too Much work, not enough rest. Not enough care for drivers. Many accidents on the roads and no help would come out for hours. Fast pace for sure in the warehouse, lots of in and out driving on the roads. I made it almost a year, but it just got to be too much for my body to handle. I am older and have a few small medical issues, so that played a part. My supervisors were very nice and I got the impression that they wanted everyone to succeed. They always tried to speak when they past by to make you feel included. I was a packer, so I stayed in one spot all day with my head down working quickly to make my rate, so there was no time to socialize. I always manage to make my rate, so if you focus and stay on task you wont have a problem. The days were long and the breaks are short, but you do get use to it. The hardest part was my body hurting every day. My first off day every week was always spent trying to recuperate and when I got home after working 10 hours it was hard to handle my family responsibilities as a wife and mother. Overall, I would still recommend working there, just not long term. The benefits are excellent and the people I worked with were nice and supportive. Amazon is one of the greeters company I ever seen. It fun working there with excellent benefit over time and time of rolls. Amazon built me and teach me in so many amazing rolls I have never thought I could do...My only Problem about Amazon is how is how your time and experience you have been or hard in the company is not valued. You could be good train all kind of employees but at the end of the day they end up becoming a PA with a better pay than you.. Sometimes I feel like is about who you know in the company and I also feel like they a little Racist and have no growing plans for Africans and Caribbean's working there but rather other people of color being given the good roll and The Africans and Caribbean's left behind which is not fair.. I enjoyed my time there it was a great experience to be able to work with a group of individuals with the sane work ethic as myself . The experience was overwhelming I like Amazon because it's a nice place to work and you can meet some real nice people is such as such a laid-back Place working with the manager and Associates "
